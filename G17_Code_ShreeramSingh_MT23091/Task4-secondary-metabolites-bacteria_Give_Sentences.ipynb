                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A. caldus is able to metabolize elemental sulfur and a broad range of ISCs.;  Based upon the recently published A. caldus type strain genome sequence, a bioinformatic reconstruction of elemental sulfur and ISC metabolism predicted genes included: sulfide–quinone reductase (sqr), tetrathionate hydrolase (tth), two sox gene clusters potentially involved in thiosulfate oxidation (soxABXYZ), sulfur oxygenase reductase (sor), and various electron transport components.;  Proteomics results also suggested the involvement of heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC) in A. caldus ISC metabolism.; A. caldus is an ISC oxidizing acidophile (Hallberg et al., 1996b) often identified in biomining environments (Okibe et al., 2003; Dopson and Lindström, 2004).;  A. caldus aids in metal dissolution by removal of solid S0 that may form a passivating layer on the mineral surface (Dopson and Lindström, 1999).;  The A. caldus draft genome contains genes for ISC oxidation (Valdes et al., 2009).;  The gene cluster containing the A. caldus tetrathionate hydrolase (tth) and the doxD component (thiosulfate:quinol oxidoreductase) has been characterized (Rzhepishevska et al., 2007).; Owing to the fact that A. caldus is ubiquitous in both natural and anthropogenic sulfide mineral environments, its importance in generating sulfuric acid, and in mitigating mineral passivation we have investigated its ISC metabolism.;  Amino acid sequences derived from selected genes previously identified to be involved in ISC metabolism were used as a query to conduct BlastP and tBlastN (Altschul et al., 1997) searches to interrogate the A. caldusT (ATCC51756) draft genome sequence (NZ_ACVD00000000.1).; A. caldusT was cultured in mineral salts medium (MSM) with trace elements (Dopson and Lindström, 1999) at 45°C and pH 2.5 whilst sparging with 2% (vol/vol) CO2 enriched air.;  In contrast, cell mass for proteomic comparison of A. caldus sessile versus planktonic growth was grown in 1 L batch cultures with initial pH 2.5.;  Peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) of mass spectra were searched against a local database containing the A. caldusT draft genome sequence (NZ_ACVD00000000.1) using Mascot with the following search parameters: (i) two missed cleavages; (ii) peptide mass tolerance of 50 ppm; and (iii) variable modifications [carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), propionamide (C)]. Hits in the local database with a Mowse score > 47 were significant at a confidence level of 95%. Two samples were analyzed by Edman degradation performed at the Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.; A detailed analysis of the genes present in the draft genome sequence of A. caldusT revealed genes for ISC oxidation that are common to A. ferrooxidans [sulfide quinone reductase (sqr), doxD, and tth] (Valdes et al., 2008) and other microbial representatives from extreme acidic environments.;  A. caldus also has gene candidates potentially encoding components of the Sox sulfur oxidizing system and Sor, which are not present in its close relative A. ferrooxidans.;  The gene clusters are presented in Figure ​Figure1A1A while the bioinformatic reconstruction of A. caldus ISC metabolism is presented in Figure ​Figure11B.; Gene clusters of enzymes potentially involved in inorganic sulfur compound (ISC) metabolism as well as gene clusters of terminal oxidases and the NADH quinone-oxidoreductase complex as predicted by bioinformatic analysis of the A. caldus genome sequence (A).;  Suggested model for ISC metabolism in A. caldus(B).;  A sulfide oxidizing activity has been identified in A. caldus but the enzyme has not been identified (Hallberg et al., 1996b).;  In A. caldus, an ortholog of the sqr (sqr-1) was identified that was divergently oriented from a gene potentially encoding Sor, that participates in the utilization of S0 as energy source in several organisms (Urich et al., 2004).;  The product of the A. caldus sqr-1 shares 40% similarity with another putative sqr ortholog (sqr-2) identified in the draft genome sequence.;  An inspection of the draft genome of A. caldus reveals the presence of a candidate tth upstream of doxD (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A).;  The putative Tth of A. caldus shares 71% similarity with the Tth of A. ferrooxidans, indicating their high similarity orthologous relationship.;  Although Tth's are predicted to be external membrane proteins, experimental evidence showed that the A. caldus Tth is a soluble periplasmic protein with maximum activity at pH 3 (Bugaytsova and Lindström, 2004).;  The A. caldus Sox complex is predicted to be formed by three periplasmic components (referred to as core TOMES): SoxAX, SoxYZ, and SoxB (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A).;  Our bioinformatics inspection did not identify soxCD orthologs in the draft genome sequence of A. caldus; however we cannot disregard the presence of these genes until the A. caldus genome sequence is finished.;  Nevertheless, based on the model for ISC metabolism in the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum proposed by Sakurai et al. (2010) it can be predicted that the A. caldus core TOMES is able to oxidize thiosulfate with the possible accumulation of S0 globules in the periplasm and it may be able to oxidize sulfite (Friedrich et al., 2001).;  No candidates for the enzymes adenylylphosphosulfate (APS) reductase or sulfate adenylyltransferases, which consecutively oxidize sulfite via an indirect pathway, have been found in the genome of A. caldus.; Another enzyme involved in A. caldus ISC metabolism not found in A. ferrooxidans is Sor (one copy of sor was identified).;  Furthermore, the predicted cytoplasmic location of the A. caldus Sor enzyme agrees with experimental data obtained from A. tengchongensis and Escherichia coli transformants (Chen et al., 2005).;  Recently, the enzyme activity of Sor has been reported to be present in A. caldus-like strains (Janosch et al., 2009).;  In A. caldus two orthologs of each HdrABC subunit have been found.;  All putative A. caldus Hdr subunits showed >90% similarity to the respective A. ferrooxidans Hdr subunits.;  As previously shown for A. ferrooxidans (Quatrini et al., 2009), the similarity to Hdr of other acidophilic sulfur oxidizers is significant whereas the similarity of the A. caldus putative HdrABC to their respective subunits of the methanogenic archaea Methanothermobacter marburgensis is only around 30%.;  Although no homologs of dsr were found in the A. caldus draft genome sequence, several potential DsrE-like proteins containing the characteristic DsrE/DsrF-like family features (Pfam 02635) were detected.;  No homolog of SoxW has been found in A. caldus; however, other thioredoxins might fulfill the same function.; A. caldus is also predicted to contain two gene clusters potentially encoding components of the NADH quinone-oxidoreductase complex (EC 1.6.5.3) as has been observed in Azotobacter vinelandii (Bertsova et al., 2001).; RNA transcript profiles of selected genes predicted to be involved in A. caldus inorganic sulfur compound metabolism.; Two dimension gel of the A. caldus soluble proteome from cells grown on tetrathionate (A; identified spots are marked with circles and the numbers indicate match IDs given without S in the figure).; Two dimension gel of the A. caldus membrane enriched proteome on tetrathionate (A; identified proteins indicated with circles and match IDs given without M in the figure).;  However, based on the bioinformatic reconstruction the involvement of NADH quinone-oxidoreductase complex and terminal oxidases in the A. caldus ISC metabolism was suggested.;  Nevertheless, the observed results motivated the proteomic investigation of sessile and planktonic A. caldus grown in S0 batch cultures as only the planktonic sub-population was investigated for the comparison of growth on tetrathionate and S0.; In 2D gels of planktonic A. caldus, three up-regulated and three unique protein spots were identified.; Two dimension gel of the A. caldus soluble proteome of sessile cells grown on S0 (A; identified proteins marked with circles and match IDs).;  Therefore, the main product of Tth in the proposed model, thiosulfate, was suggested to be oxidized by the A. caldus SoxABXYZ system.;  As homologs of neither Sox(CD)2 nor DsrAB were detected in the genome sequence of A. caldus to date it is proposed that the products of its core TOMES are sulfate and S0.;  This aspect is further strengthened by the observation that thiosulfate oxidation has a S0 intermediate (Hallberg et al., 1996b) and that S0 globules have been detected in A. caldus when under sub-optimal conditions (Hallberg et al., 1996a).;  In this study HdrA was up-regulated in S0 grown A. caldus, whereas HdrC was up-regulated in tetrathionate grown cells.;  The potential use of Hdr and/or Sor in A. caldus S0 oxidation remains to be resolved.;  For instance, the Sor enzyme identified in A. caldus-like strains has an increased activity at 65°C (Janosch et al., 2009) suggesting it may be used at higher growth temperatures.;  Although no candidate for a sulfite oxidizing enzyme was detected in the proteomics a sulfite oxidase activity has been reported for A. caldus (Hallberg et al., 1996b) and a candidate for a sulfite oxidizing enzyme without heme domain was detected in the genome sequence.; The A. caldus planktonic proteome contained up-regulated proteins similar to the expression pattern of tetrathionate grown cells; whereas, the sessile proteome contained up-regulated proteins that were described to be signature proteins of tetrathionate and S0 grown cells.;  The growth medium of A. caldus grown on S0 was tested for tetrathionate and thiosulfate.;  The reported differences in the proteomes between sessile and planktonic A. caldus sub-populations comprised a comparatively small number of differentially expressed proteins.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Whole-genome sequence analyses show that the isolate, A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45168T have genome sizes of 7.9, 9.6 and 6.7 Mbp, respectively.;  Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA:DNA hybridization similarities are below the recommended thresholds for assigning strains to the same species; they also indicate that isolate MGRD01-02T is most closely related to the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains.;  The C. acidiphila strain was obtained from the collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, USA, the A. durhamensis strain from the personal collection of Michael Goodfellow (Newcastle University) and the remaining strains from the Leibniz Institute, DSMZ German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany.; Genomic DNA was extracted from wet biomass of single colonies of isolate MGRD01-02T and A. durhamensis CSCA 57T which had been grown on acidified ISP 2 agar (pH 4.5), and on acidified R2A agar (Reasoner and Geldreich 1985), pH 4.5, for A puniceicyclus DSM 45618T for 7 days at 28 °C, using the protocol provided by MicrobesNG (Birmingham, UK) (http://www.microbesng.uk), and sequenced on an Miseq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, USA).;  Draft genome sequences of isolate MGDR01-02T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSOH000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2029756619\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSOH000000000\"}}JAGSOH000000000), A. durhamensis CSCA 57T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSOG000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2029756623\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSOG000000000\"}}JAGSOG000000000) and A. puniceicyclus DSM 45168T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSXH000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2032654651\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSXH000000000\"}}JAGSXH000000000) were generated following an established procedure undertaken by MicrobesNG (Birmingham, UK) (http://www.microbesng.uk) and sequenced on an MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, USA).; The draft genome sequences generated for the isolate and the, A. durhamensis and A. puniceicyclus strains were compared with corresponding sequences of A. acidiphila NRRL B-24431T, A. robiniae DSM 44927T, and C. acidiphila DSM 44928T retrieved from the NCBI genome database using the codon tree option in the PATRIC website (Wattam et al. 2017; Davis et al. 2020), as described by Kusuma et al. (2021), and a ML phylogenomic tree constructed with the RAxML algorithm (Stamatakis 2014).;  Like representatives of A. acidiphila, A. durhamensis and A. robiniae the fatty acid profile of the isolate was composed of major proportions of iso-C15:0 (25.8%) and iso-C16:0 (23.7%), but unlike them, it contained major amounts of anteiso-C18:0/C18:2 (33.2%) and only a minor proportion of anteiso-C15:0.; The accession numbers of the draft genomes are given in Table ​Table11 which also shows that the isolate and A. durhamensis CSCA 57T have large genomes, albeit ones lower than those of the type strains of A. acidiphila (9.6 Mbp, GenBank accession number NJ-JNYX 0000000), A. robiniae (9.9 Mbp, GenBank accession number NZ-{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AZAN00000000\",\"term_id\":\"563517757\",\"term_text\":\"AZAN00000000\"}}AZAN00000000) and C. acidiphila (10.5 Mbp, GCA—000024025).;  These strains shared lower similarity values with the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains and an even lower value of 95.40% with A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T, this similarity value is equivalent to 84 nt differences at 1394 locations.;  The isolate and the type strains of A. durhamensis and A. robiniae formed a distinct subclade while those of A. puniceicyclus, C. acidiphila and A. acidiphila were recovered as well-separated lineages within the tree that were increasingly distant from the subclade.;  These data also show that the isolate is most closely related to A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44926T and most distantly to A. acidiphila NRRL B-24431T and C. acidiphila DSM 44928T.;  The close relationship between the isolate, A. durhamensis and A. robiniae was supported by AAI and POCP values that were well above the 70 and 50% thresholds used to assign species to the same genus (Konstantinidis and Tiedje 2005; Qin et al. 2014), as shown in Table ​Table2.2.;  The isolate, for instance, can be separated from all of the other strains as it degraded hypoxanthine and grew at 45*C, and from A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, its nearest phylogenomic relatives, by its ability to use inulin as a sole carbon source and by an inability to produce α- and β-galactosidases, β-glucuronidase and cystine, leucine and valine arylamidases.;  The A. acidiphila strain, unlike the isolate and the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains, degraded starch and used acetamide and L-alanine as sole nitrogen sources.;  Putative BGCs associated with the production of sporolide were found in the genomes of isolate MGRD01-02T, A. durhamensis CSCA57T and A. robiniae DSM 44926T whereas the biocluster predicted to encode for macrotetralide was only detected in the genomes of the isolate and the A. pumiceicyclus strain.; Strain-specific BCCs included ones associated with the production of tiacumicin B (6% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound (Xiao et al. 2011), atratumycin (21% gene identity), an anti-tubercular antibiotic (Sun et al. 2019), auroramycin (11% gene identity), an antibiotic that actively inhibits Staphylococcus aureus (Duggar 2011), catenulipeptin (100% gene identity), a novel class III lantipeptide (Wang and Donk 2012), kirromycin (8% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound active against Brevibacterium brevis (Wolf et al. 1972) and ristomycin A (10% gene identity), an antibiotic which inhibits mycobacteria (Fairbrother 1958) were characteristic of the genomes of isolate MGRD01-02T, A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T, A. acidiphila DSM 44926T, C. acidiphila DSM 44928T, A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, respectively.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                   Bioinformatics analysis of circular dichroism data indicates that the group 1 LEA protein AfLEA1 is surprisingly ordered in the hydrated state and undergoes during desiccation one of the most pronounced disorder-to-order transitions described for LEA proteins from A. franciscana.;  However, despite a uniquely broad range of expressed LEA proteins, the knockdown of Group 1 LEA proteins by RNAi reduced the cyst desiccation tolerance by over 90% [11]. Therefore, expressed proteins from other groups do not readily substitute the anhydrobiotic functions performed by Group 1 LEA proteins in A. franciscana.;  Understanding the mechanism(s) by which AfLEA1 improves water-stress tolerance in A. franciscana may facilitate the development of methods to engineer anhydrobiotic research cell lines and water-stress tolerant medical stem cells.; A minimum of five similar Group 1 LEA proteins are concurrently expressed in A. franciscana and localize to the cytosol and the mitochondrion [10,11,12,13]. These proteins contain 2 to 8 repeats of a Group 1 amino acid motif (GGOTRREQLGEEGYSQMGRK) and, based on the EST data available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), are composed of 62 to 217 amino acids [10]. The observation of Group 1 LEA proteins being present in both the cytosol and the mitochondria may offer insight into their role(s) in desiccation tolerance.;  The sequence features of AfLEA1 have been investigated using bioinformatics, and in vivo experiments have been performed by transfecting E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells with AfLEA1 variants [13,17]. In these experiments, no improvements in osmotic stress tolerance could be detected for E. coli, and modest improvements in viability after freezing and drying were observed in yeast [13]. Similar observations were made after expressing a mitochondrial-targeted AfLEA1 variant from A. franciscana in Kc167 cells from D. melanogaster.; Nonetheless, methods have been developed to deduce the secondary structure of LEA proteins in the desiccated state using bioinformatics and circular dichroism [19,20]. Recently, the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior of a Group 6 LEA protein was investigated using a combination of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and drying procedures in the presence of osmolytes found in the anhydrobiotic cyst of A. franciscana [21]. Utilizing similar techniques and guided by computation tools, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of AfLEA1 during desiccation, and our findings provide new insights into two specific hypotheses regarding LEA protein functions: molecular shielding [22] and hydration buffering [23].; A solution resembling the crowded cytoplasm of the diapause cysts of A. franciscana (32 mM NaCl, 98 mM KCl, 11 mM K2PO4, 5 mM CaCl2, 340 mM trehalose, 2.9% w/v glycerol, and 25% Ficoll 400, pH of 6.5) was prepared, and 150 μg/mL of AfLEA1 was added to determine whether AfLEA1 undergoes LLPS during desiccation.;  RNA (20 ng/mL final concentration) isolated from A. franciscana using a total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was added to the protein droplet to determine the impact on the LLPS behavior of AfLEA1. ;  For example, the Group 3 LEA proteins AfrLEA2 and AfrLEA3m (A. franciscana) are only ordered to 21% and 25%, respectively [31]. However, AfLEA1 undergoes a dramatic conformational transition in the desiccated state.;  Despite being more structured than most LEA proteins in the hydrated state, this conformational transition is the most dramatic shift from disorder to order reported for an LEA protein from A. franciscana.; Three-dimensional structure and charge distribution of three LEA proteins from A. franciscana as predicted by I-Tasser.;  Desiccation experiments were conducted in a buffer system that resembles the cellular environment of the encysted embryos of A. franciscana to determine whether AfLEA1 undergoes LLPS in a physiologically more relevant background.;  After adding total RNA isolated from A. franciscana to AfLEA1 samples before drying, the protein undergoes an LLPS readily after minor water removal by evaporative drying (Figure 9B).; AfLEA1 undergoes LLPS during desiccation in vitro in a solution mimicking the intracellular conditions in A. franciscana. (A) When desiccated in the absence of RNA, AfLEA1 undergoes LLPS (black arrow) at severe dehydration concurrent with the formation of salt crystals in the solution (white arrow). (B) When desiccated in the presence of mRNA from A. franciscana, AfLEA1 rapidly undergoes LLPS at higher water contents than in an RNA-free solution and before salt crystals are formed.; AfLEA1 and its protein variants in the animal extremophile A. franciscana are the only known Group 1 LEA proteins in this kingdom of life.; The reason(s) for multiple Group 1 LEA proteins that virtually only differ in their number of Group 1 repeats in A. franciscana is intriguing and requires further investigation.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA:DNA hybridization similarities are below the recommended thresholds for assigning strains to the same species; they also indicate that isolate MGRD01-02T is most closely related to the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains.; The draft genome sequences generated for the isolate and the, A. durhamensis and A. puniceicyclus strains were compared with corresponding sequences of A. acidiphila NRRL B-24431T, A. robiniae DSM 44927T, and C. acidiphila DSM 44928T retrieved from the NCBI genome database using the codon tree option in the PATRIC website (Wattam et al. 2017; Davis et al. 2020), as described by Kusuma et al. (2021), and a ML phylogenomic tree constructed with the RAxML algorithm (Stamatakis 2014).;  Like representatives of A. acidiphila, A. durhamensis and A. robiniae the fatty acid profile of the isolate was composed of major proportions of iso-C15:0 (25.8%) and iso-C16:0 (23.7%), but unlike them, it contained major amounts of anteiso-C18:0/C18:2 (33.2%) and only a minor proportion of anteiso-C15:0.; The accession numbers of the draft genomes are given in Table ​Table11 which also shows that the isolate and A. durhamensis CSCA 57T have large genomes, albeit ones lower than those of the type strains of A. acidiphila (9.6 Mbp, GenBank accession number NJ-JNYX 0000000), A. robiniae (9.9 Mbp, GenBank accession number NZ-{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AZAN00000000\",\"term_id\":\"563517757\",\"term_text\":\"AZAN00000000\"}}AZAN00000000) and C. acidiphila (10.5 Mbp, GCA—000024025).;  These strains shared lower similarity values with the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains and an even lower value of 95.40% with A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T, this similarity value is equivalent to 84 nt differences at 1394 locations.;  The isolate and the type strains of A. durhamensis and A. robiniae formed a distinct subclade while those of A. puniceicyclus, C. acidiphila and A. acidiphila were recovered as well-separated lineages within the tree that were increasingly distant from the subclade.;  These data also show that the isolate is most closely related to A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44926T and most distantly to A. acidiphila NRRL B-24431T and C. acidiphila DSM 44928T.;  The close relationship between the isolate, A. durhamensis and A. robiniae was supported by AAI and POCP values that were well above the 70 and 50% thresholds used to assign species to the same genus (Konstantinidis and Tiedje 2005; Qin et al. 2014), as shown in Table ​Table2.2.;  The isolate, for instance, can be separated from all of the other strains as it degraded hypoxanthine and grew at 45*C, and from A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, its nearest phylogenomic relatives, by its ability to use inulin as a sole carbon source and by an inability to produce α- and β-galactosidases, β-glucuronidase and cystine, leucine and valine arylamidases.;  The A. acidiphila strain, unlike the isolate and the A. durhamensis and A. robiniae strains, degraded starch and used acetamide and L-alanine as sole nitrogen sources.;  Putative BGCs associated with the production of sporolide were found in the genomes of isolate MGRD01-02T, A. durhamensis CSCA57T and A. robiniae DSM 44926T whereas the biocluster predicted to encode for macrotetralide was only detected in the genomes of the isolate and the A. pumiceicyclus strain.; Strain-specific BCCs included ones associated with the production of tiacumicin B (6% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound (Xiao et al. 2011), atratumycin (21% gene identity), an anti-tubercular antibiotic (Sun et al. 2019), auroramycin (11% gene identity), an antibiotic that actively inhibits Staphylococcus aureus (Duggar 2011), catenulipeptin (100% gene identity), a novel class III lantipeptide (Wang and Donk 2012), kirromycin (8% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound active against Brevibacterium brevis (Wolf et al. 1972) and ristomycin A (10% gene identity), an antibiotic which inhibits mycobacteria (Fairbrother 1958) were characteristic of the genomes of isolate MGRD01-02T, A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T, A. acidiphila DSM 44926T, C. acidiphila DSM 44928T, A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, respectively.\n",

iron-oxidizers (Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) and a heterotrophic iron-oxidizer (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”).;  Streamers were sampled only at the Dyffryn Adda adit portal during October and November, while in December they were also sampled 90 m downstream of this point. terminal restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis indicated that the composition of the streamers was similar in all cases, with two species of autotrophic iron-oxidizing proteobacteria (“Fv. myxofaciens” and Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans) and a heterotrophic iron-oxidizing isolate (actinobacterium Py-F3) accounting for most of the biomass present.;  These were “Ferrovum myxofaciens” (strain P3G), Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans (strain Py-F1), and a novel actinobacterium (strain Py-F3).;  Three iron-oxidizing bacteria dominated the streamer communities, two of which (Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) were obligate chemolithotrophs and the third (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”) a heterotrophic acidophile.\n",

became rapidly colonized by acidophilic bacteria: two species of autotrophic iron-oxidizers (Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) and a heterotrophic iron-oxidizer (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”).;  The binomial “Acidithrix ferrooxidans” is proposed for isolate Py-F3 (denoting its ability for filamentous growth and to oxidize iron) and work on fully characterizing this novel actinobacterium is continuing.;  The 16S rRNA gene sequence identities to both Fm. acidiphilum (95%) and “Acidithrix ferrooxidans” (< 92%) suggest that this is another novel species (or genus) of acidophilic actinobacteria.;  Three iron-oxidizing bacteria dominated the streamer communities, two of which (Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) were obligate chemolithotrophs and the third (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”) a heterotrophic acidophile.\n",

other Acinetobacter strains highlighted a number of unique genes, such as a novel cryptochrome.;  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a genome from a polyextremophilic Acinetobacter strain.;  A set of almost one hundred UV-resistant strains were isolated and identified (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006; Zenoff et al., 2006; Dib et al., 2008; Flores et al., 2009; Ordoñez et al., 2009; Bequer Urbano et al., 2013) in which Acinetobacter strains were the most abundant.;  Experimental evidence suggest a particularly high antioxidant activity (Di Capua et al., 2011) as well as an efficient DNA damage photorepairing ability (Albarracín et al., 2012), particularly in Acinetobacter sp.;  More recently, Acinetobacter radioresistans and other species have been isolated from spacecraft assembly rooms (McCoy et al., 2012; Derecho et al., 2014).; In this work, we present the complete genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp.; UV-resistant strain Acinetobacter sp.;  Acinetobacter culture collection strains taxonomically related with Ver3, including Acinetobacter johnsonnii DSM 6963, Acinetobacter lwoffii DSM 2403, and Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007 from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), as well as Escherichia coli strains KY1056 and KY1224 were used as controls in the UV-resistance assays (Albarracín et al., 2012).; To

sp.; Phylogenetic analysis of 55 Acinetobacter strains.;  Strain Acinetobacter sp.;  Even after the highest dose tested (ca. 43 kJ m-2), Ver3 remained viable (30% survival) while CFU remained below detection limit for all other Acinetobacter strains.;  For comparison, in E. coli KY1056, a photolyase-containing UV tolerant strain and its knock-out mutant, E. coli KY1225, the lethal dose (1.2 kJ m-2) was very much lower than that for the Acinetobacter spp. (Albarracín et al., 2014).; Survival of strains A. baumannii DSM 30007, A. johnsonii DSM 6963, A. lwoffii DSM 2403, and Acinetobacter sp.; The genome of Acinetobacter sp.;  These data is shown in Table ​Table11, and compared to the Acinetobacter strains with data on their UV-resistance profiles (Figure ​Figure22).; General features of the genomes of the Acinetobacter strains used in this study.; Genome comparison of the strains A. baumannii DSM 30007, A. johnsonii DSM 6963, A. lwoffii DSM 2403, and Acinetobacter sp.; DNA repair genes found in Acinetobacter sp.;  MutL and MutS are present in Ver3, and also in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, where they have been shown to be involved in mismatch recognition to prevent recombination of foreign DNA (Young and Ornston, 2001).;  Homologs to the MutH endonuclease were not found, not only in Ver3, but also in none of the sequenced Acinetobacter in NCBI.;  In Acinetobacter, it also has a role in the acquisition of foreign DNA (de Vries and Wackernagel, 2002).;  However, the response is quite different in Acinetobacter, particularly because mutagenesis is rarely seen, with the notable exception of the emerging pathogens A. baumannii and Acinetobacter ursingii.;  A group of Acinetobacter UmuD proteins are 1.5 times larger than the E. coli counterparts, being named UmuDAb (Hare et al., 2006).;  Recent work on HAAL environmental strains examined accumulation of CPDs and 6-4PPs in Acinetobacter UV-resistant strains N40, Ver3, Ver5, and Ver7, compared to type strains A. johnsonii DSM 6963 (AJ) and A. baumannii DSM 30007 (AB).;  Even though the protein is “unique” in Ver3 when comparing four strains on this work, a BLAST search against NCBI nr database filtered for different Acinetobacter species retrieved proteins with high identity (>90%) in other A. baumannii and A. johnsonii strains, but no homologs were found in A. lwoffii.; Genes related to oxidative response found in Acinetobacter sp.;  Our comparative analysis showed a total of 11 genes annotated as catalases in the selected Acinetobacter strains: two in Ver3, four in A. baumannii, four in A. lwoffii, and one in A. johnsonii.;  Two active catalase species were present in most Acinetobacter strains tested, while a single catalase band was visible in Ver3 that would correspond to the cytoplasmic catalase {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EZQ12194\",\"term_id\":\"612175641\",\"term_text\":\"EZQ12194\"}}EZQ12194, and no bands were detected in A. johnsonii.;  Both ahpF genes are in the very 5′ end of the contigs, the actual ORFs might be longer, and thus we cannot confirm their size from this data, although short genes annotated as ahpF can be found in Acinetobacter strains but have never been characterized.;  The Acinetobacter Ver3 Ohr putative protein has a high identity with the protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (71.7%) and bears the two conserved Cys required for functionality (Lesniak et al., 2002).;  Acinetobacter sp.; The expression profiles of Acinetobacter sp.; (A) Growth of Acinetobacter sp.; The proteome of Acinetobacter sp.;  Catalases were also shown to be important in polyextremophilic Acinetobacter strains isolated from spacecraft assembly sites, exposed to multiple stress conditions, including UV-C, H2O2, and desiccation (McCoy et al., 2012; Derecho et al., 2014).;  Additionally, Acinetobacter sp.;  Comparison with the Acinetobacter strains showed that these regulators have orthologs in all of them, with the exception of one ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EZQ10400\",\"term_id\":\"612173806\",\"term_text\":\"EZQ10400\"}}EZQ10400), which is unique in Ver3.;  DABA-AT is involved in biosynthesis of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP; Ikai and Yamamoto, 1997), a polyamine accumulated in members of Acinetobacter genus (Hamana and Matsuzaki, 1992).;  This result suggested that Acinetobacter increased protein synthesis (maybe specific ones with high content of histidine) required to combat the cellular stress caused by the radiation.;  This last protein is annotated by RAST in Acinetobacter sp.; In this paper we presented the genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp.;  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a genome from a polyextremophilic Acinetobacter strain.;  Comparison with genomes of other taxonomically related Acinetobacter strains highlighted a number of unique genes, such as a novel cryptochrome (PhlK).; Our results help to unravel the

Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45168T have genome sizes of 7.9, 9.6 and 6.7 Mbp, respectively.;  Corresponding amino acid identity and conserved protein data not only support these relationships but also confirm the taxonomic integrity of the genus Actinocrinis.; The family Actinospicaceae (Cavaletti et al. 2006) of the order Catenulisporales (Donadio et al. 2015) contains the genera Actinospica (Cavaletti et al. 2006) and Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017); the former encompasses three validly published species, including Actinospica robiniae, the nomenclatural type species, and the latter Actinocrinis puniceicyclus.;  Strain MGRD01-02T was compared with the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species using genomic and phenotypic data.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T (Golinska et al. 2015), Actinospica robiniae DSM 44927T (Cavaletti et al. 2006), Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45618T and Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928T, were maintained on modified Bennett’s agar at pH 4.5 (Jones 1949) and as a mixture of hyphal fragments and spores in 20% w/v glycerol at − 20 and − 80 °C.;  The 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared with corresponding sequences of the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species taken from the EZBioCloud webserver following multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE software (Edgar 2010).;  These properties distinguish the isolate from species classified in the genera Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017) and Catenulispora (Świecimska et al. 2020).; Genomic features of isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinospica durhamensis and Actinocrinis puniceicyclus; Maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) trees inferred using the GTR + GAMMA model based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showing relationships between isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinocrinis, Actinospica and Catenulispora species.; Maximum-likelihood phylogenomic tree based on 441 single copy core genes showing relationships between isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species.;  It is also encouraging that the results for many of the tests confirmed those recorded in earlier analyses on the Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora type strains (Golinska et al. 2015; Świecimska et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2017).;  Similarly, the isolate and the other Actinospica strains can be separated from the Actinocrinis and Catenulispora strains as they are positive for esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8) and β-glucosidase.;  Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45168T, 6.; Putative natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (NP-BGCs) detected in the draft genome of isolate MGRD01-02T and in those of the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species using the default option of AntiSMASH 5.0;  The results of this study also confirm the taxonomic integrity of the genus Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017).\n",

puniceicyclus DSM 45168T have genome sizes of 7.9, 9.6 and 6.7 Mbp, respectively.; The family Actinospicaceae (Cavaletti et al. 2006) of the order Catenulisporales (Donadio et al. 2015) contains the genera Actinospica (Cavaletti et al. 2006) and Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017); the former encompasses three validly published species, including Actinospica robiniae, the nomenclatural type species, and the latter Actinocrinis puniceicyclus.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T (Golinska et al. 2015), Actinospica robiniae DSM 44927T (Cavaletti et al. 2006), Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45618T and Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928T, were maintained on modified Bennett’s agar at pH 4.5 (Jones 1949) and as a mixture of hyphal fragments and spores in 20% w/v glycerol at − 20 and − 80 °C.; Genomic

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A polyphasic study was designed to resolve the taxonomic position of isolate MGRD01-02T which was recovered from an acidic hot spring in Indonesia and assigned to the genus Actinospica.;  Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences show that the isolate is most closely related to the type strains of Actinospica acidiphila (98.5%), Actinospica robiniae (97.8%) and Actinospica durhamensis (96.8%).;  Morphological and chemotaxonomic data underpin the assignment of the isolate to the genus Actinospica as it forms an extensively branched substrate mycelium which carries tufts of white aerial hyphae that differentiate into straight to flexuous chains of cylindrical spores with faint rugose surfaces, contains 2,6-diamino-3-hydroxydiaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan, mixtures of hydrogenated menaquinones with nine isoprene units, iso-C 15:O and iso-C 16:O as major fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamine as the diagnostic phospholipid.;  Based on these results, it is proposed that isolate MGRD01-02T (= CCMM B1308T = ICEBB-09T = NCIMB 15218T) be classified in the genus Actinospica as Actinospica acidithermotolerans sp. nov.;  In general, acid-loving filamentous actinomycetes encompass acidotolerant (pH range 4.5–7.5., optimal growth around pH 5.5) and obligate acidophiles (pH range 3.5–6.5, optimal growth around pH 4.5 (Williams et al. 1971), as represented by Streptomyces (Xu et al. 2006) and Actinospica species (Cavaletti et al. 2006; Golinska et al. 2015), respectively.; The family Actinospicaceae (Cavaletti et al. 2006) of the order Catenulisporales (Donadio et al. 2015) contains the genera Actinospica (Cavaletti et al. 2006) and Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017); the former encompasses three validly published species, including Actinospica robiniae, the nomenclatural type species, and the latter Actinocrinis puniceicyclus.;  The present study, a continuation of our earlier work on the diversity of filamentous actinomycetes from Indonesian extreme habitats, was designed to establish the taxonomic status of an Actinospica strain isolated from acidic hot spring sediment.;  Strain MGRD01-02T was compared with the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species using genomic and phenotypic data.;  The isolate was shown to belong to a new Actinospica species: the name proposed for this taxon is Actinospica acidithermotolerans with isolate MGRD01-02T as the type strain.;  The isolate together with Actinospica acidiphila NRRL B-24432T.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T (Golinska et al. 2015), Actinospica robiniae DSM 44927T (Cavaletti et al. 2006), Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45618T and Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928T, were maintained on modified Bennett’s agar at pH 4.5 (Jones 1949) and as a mixture of hyphal fragments and spores in 20% w/v glycerol at − 20 and − 80 °C.;  The 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared with corresponding sequences of the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species taken from the EZBioCloud webserver following multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE software (Edgar 2010).; The morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of the isolate were consistent with its classification in the genus Actinospica (Cavaletti et al. 2006; Golinska et al. 2015).; Actinospica species show qualitative differences in sugar and polar lipid patterns, and qualitative and quantitative variations in fatty acid and menaquinone profiles (Cavaletti et al. 2006; Golinska et al. 2015).;  These chemotaxonomic properties distinguish the isolate from the type strains of Actinospica species, as exemplified by the detection of xylose and phosphatidylglycerol in the sugar and polar lipid profiles, respectively.;  Similarly, the presence of major proportions of di-, tri-, hexa- and octa-hydrogenated menaquinones with nine isoprene units (19, 21, 26 and 29%, respectively) in the isolate distinguishes it from profiles found in the Actinospica strains, as illustrated by the presence of a large proportion of MK9 (H2).;  However, the digital (d) DNA G + C values of the Actinospica strains fall within the narrow range of 70.2 to 72.6%. In contrast, the draft genome size of A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T was relatively low at 6.7 Mbp though its in silico G + C value of 70.5% was just short of that recorded for isolate MGRD01-02T.; Genomic features of isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinospica durhamensis and Actinocrinis puniceicyclus; The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1) based on the 16 rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolate, the type strains of the Actinospica species and A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T formed a well-supported clade that was most closely related to a similarly well-defined lineage that corresponded to the genus Catenulispora.;  The strains assigned to the Actinospica 16S rRNA gene clade shared sequence similarities with the Catenulispora strains within the range 92.0–92.8%, which is equivalent to 100 to 140 nt differences, respectively.;  The recovery of the Actinospica and Catenulispora strains in sister clades reinforces results recorded from earlier studies (Nouioui et al. 2018; Golinska et al. 2015; Świecimska et al. 2020) though in the latter two studies the type strain of A. puniceicyclus formed a distinct phyletic line towards the periphery of the Actinospica clade.; Maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) trees inferred using the GTR + GAMMA model based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showing relationships between isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinocrinis, Actinospica and Catenulispora species.; Maximum-likelihood phylogenomic tree based on 441 single copy core genes showing relationships between isolate MGRD01-02T and the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species.;  It is also encouraging that the results for many of the tests confirmed those recorded in earlier analyses on the Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora type strains (Golinska et al. 2015; Świecimska et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2017).;  Similarly, the isolate and the other Actinospica strains can be separated from the Actinocrinis and Catenulispora strains as they are positive for esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8) and β-glucosidase.;  Actinospica acidiphila NRRL B-24431T, 3.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T, 4.;  Actinospica robiniae DSM 44926T, 5.;  S2) and yeast extract–malt extract agar plates as did the Actinospica and Catenulispora strains, but showed varying responses on the remaining ISP media (Table S1).;  However, the isolate can be separated from the other Actinospica strains as it formed a greyish-yellow substrate mycelium on yeast extract-malt extract and oatmeal agar plates and a brown diffusible pigment on inorganic salts-starch agar.; Putative natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (NP-BGCs) detected in the draft genome of isolate MGRD01-02T and in those of the type strains of Actinospica, Actinocrinis and Catenulispora species using the default option of AntiSMASH 5.0;  Even so, these studies indicate that Actinospica and Catenulispora strains should be considered as candidates for bioprospecting campaigns designed to discover novel specialized metabolites of biotechnological value, not least antibiotics with new modes of action.; This polyphasic study shows that isolate MGRD01-02T is an authentic member of the genus Actinospica.;  Critically, it can be distinguished from the type strains of Actinospica species using a combination of genomic, genotypic and phenotypic features.;  Consequently, it should be classified as a novel species in the genus Actinospica for which the name Actinospica acidithermotolerans sp. nov. is proposed.;  Improved procedures are needed to selectively isolate and characterize novel actinomycetes, including Actinospica strains, from hot springs for biotechnological and ecophysiological purposes.; Actinospica acidithermotolerans sp. nov.

The family Actinospicaceae (Cavaletti et al. 2006) of the order Catenulisporales (Donadio et al. 2015) contains the genera Actinospica (Cavaletti et al. 2006) and Actinocrinis (Kim et al. 2017); the former encompasses three validly published species, including Actinospica robiniae, the nomenclatural type species, and the latter Actinocrinis puniceicyclus.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T

(A) Growth comparison of Eutrema and Arabidopsis plants in the control and NaCl treatment (100, 200, 300, and 400 mM NaCl) conditions.;  Eutrema seeds germinated 10 days, and Arabidopsis seeds germinated for 7 days in 1/2 MS medium, then the seedlings of uniform growth moved to 1/2 MS medium containing 0 (CK), 100, 200, 300, and 400 mM NaCl for growing for about 5 days. (B) Growth comparison of the 50-day-old Eutrema and 30-day-old Arabidopsis plants that grow in a mixture of vermiculite, perlite and peat moss (1:1:1), with a photoperiod of 16 h light/22°C and 8 h dark/18°C. (C) Growth comparison of the 60-day-old Eutrema and 40-day-old Arabidopsis plants.;  The surface sterilized Arabidopsis seeds planted in 1/2 MS medium, was firstly stratified treatment in 4°C for 3 days, then moved into a growth chamber for 7 days; the seedlings were transplanted in nutrient soil containing vermiculite, perlite, and peat moss (1:1:1) for 24 days, followed by 6-day salt treatment using 200 mM NaCl. (D) Phenotype comparison of Eutrema plants under salt, drought, and cold stresses.; Over the past few years, this salt cress species has come to the fore in the research into abiotic stress resistance and is considered a plant model of stress resistance well comparable with the Arabidopsis genome (Bressan et al., 2001; Inan et al., 2004; Amtmann et al., 2005; Amtmann, 2009).;  Secondly, comparative analyses of the genome structures, protein-coding genes, microRNAs, stress-related pathways, and proteomic and metabolic profiles between Eutrema and Arabidopsis suggest that adaptation of the halophyte to environmental salt stress may occur via a global network adjustment of multiple regulatory mechanisms (Yang et al., 2013).;  Among these, the AtNFXL1 gene encoding NF-X1 type zinc finger proteins was suggested to play a regulatory role in protecting photosynthesis, and be required for the growth of Arabidopsis plants under salt stress.;  The expansions of these gene family members are suggested to be associated with the adaptation of salt cress to harsh environments, due to the fact that their orthologous gene members in Arabidopsis and other plants have been documented to be associated with stress resistance (Lisso et al., 2006; Ogawa et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2012).;  Given the expressions of RAVs in Arabidopsis were reduced by salt and dryness, it is inferred that adaption of reduced AtRAV1 expression is involved in the adaption of salinity environment in Arabidopsis (Fu et al., 2014).; The expanded genes or gene family members involved in response to salt stress in Eutrema compared with Arabidopsis.;  In E. salsugineum, LEA genes were found to be higher copy numbers than their orthologous genes in the Arabidopsis genome, which is in agreement with a higher frequency of gene duplications observed in the E. salsugineum and E. parvula genomes (Table 1).;  This indicated that, since the last whole genome duplication event or after tandem duplications leading to neofunctionalization, the two Eutrema species (E. salsugineum and E. parvula) retained a higher fraction of duplicated genes, which is regarded as an important adaptive strategy for salt cress to survive in habitats with more extreme environmental conditions than Arabidopsis (Blanc and Wolfe, 2004a,b; Maere et al., 2005; Dassanayake et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2013).;  In this pathway, Arabidopsis AtCBL10 calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger, which initiates the transport of sodium out of the cell (Shi et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2002, 2003; Quintero et al., 2002).;  Taken together, the duplication of Eutrema EsCBL10 obviously increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity and conferred an enhanced salt tolerance when compared with salt-sensitive Arabidopsis (Monihan et al., 2019).;  Under treatments of 100 and 200 mM NaCl, an increased growth was observed in E. salsugineum accompanied by almost unchanged fresh and dry weights (Figures 1, ​,2),2), whereas a significant growth reduction in Arabidopsis.;  However, the growth of Arabidopsis was remarkably decreased by the 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments, which was associated with strong suppression in both leaf initiation and leaf expansion (M'rah et al., 2007; Sui and Han, 2014).;  Compared to Arabidopsis, E. salsugineum leaves are more succulent-like, have a second layer of palisade mesophyll cells, and frequently fall off during extreme salt stress, while root tissues develop an extra endodermis and cortex cell layer (Inan et al., 2004; Figure 2).;  Meanwhile, the stomata of E. salsugineum leaf surface are present at a higher density and less open than that in Arabidopsis, and exhibit a more tightly closing when responding to salt stress (Inan et al., 2004; Figure 2).;  Therefore, when compared with Arabidopsis, E. salsugineum can maintain a high water uptake and ion transport (Volkov et al., 2004; M'rah et al., 2006, 2007; Amtmann, 2009).;  In leaves of Arabidopsis, the photosynthetic activity was suppressed after 15 days of salt treatment with higher than 50 mM NaCl, which could be explained by the stomata closure and dramatic shrinkage of the RubisCO pool.;  When plants are subjected to 100 or 200 mM NaCl treatments, there are no remarkable changes in the chlorophyll content and Chl a/b ratio, as well as almost do not affect the PSII activity in E. salsugineum leaf (Figure 2), whereas a progressive decline exists in Arabidopsis leaf, which suggests this halophyte has effective mechanisms to protect photosystem against salinity (Sui and Han, 2014).;  Likewise, Kant et al. (2006) demonstrated that E. salsugineum SOS1 transcript was strongly induced by salt in the shoots, and a constitutively high expression existed in roots in unstressed salt cress, which was consistent with a lower salt-induced Na+ concentration in xylem sap of E. salsugineum than that in Arabidopsis (Kant et al., 2006).;  Further, ectopic expression of EsSOS1 from E. salsugineum suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking Na+ efflux transporters (SOS1), and enhanced the salt tolerance of wild-type Arabidopsis (Oh et al., 2009).;  Further, the plants overexpressing Eutrema EsHKT1;2 in Arabidopsis athkt1 mutant was proved to be less sensitive to Na+ as well as less K+ deficiency, compared to the plants overexpressing AtHKT1 gene in athkt1 (Ali et al., 2012).;  Moreover, Arabidopsis plants (Col-gl) overexpressing EpHKT1;2 gene accumulated less Na+ and more K+, and displayed significantly higher tolerance to salt stress when compared to those overexpressing EpHKT1;1 or AtHKT1.;  Notably, although most genes in E. salsugineum exhibit ~90% identity with Arabidopsis genes, the size of E. salsugineum transport genes population is ~1.5 times that compared of the corresponding Arabidopsis genes (Taji et al., 2008).;  This suggests that the transporter encoding genes could be remarkably different from their co-orthologs in Arabidopsis, and regulate a unique ion transportation system in this halophyte (Taji et al., 2008).;  Correspondingly, Eutrema accumulated lower levels of Na+ and Cl− than Arabidopsis, and its rosette leaves displayed more efficient protective mechanisms against Na+ metabolic toxicity when plants were exposed to higher salinity stress (M'rah et al., 2007).;  These works of key Na+-transport mechanisms provide some detailed mechanisms analysis underlying salinity tolerance in this halophytic E. salsugineum, an Arabidopsis relative model system (Vera-Estrella et al., 2005; Figures 2, ​,33).;  Meantime, the salinity-induced thylakoid swelling was detected only in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, while no signs of such destruction occurred in E. salsugineum chloroplasts (Pilarska et al., 2016).;  Arabidopsis NOX genes, RBOHD and RBOHF, are the main genes encoding NADPH oxidases associated with acclimation to salinity (Ma et al., 2012; Pilarska et al., 2021).;  After E. salsugineum was exposed to 5 days of salinity, a salt-stimulated expression in RBOHD and RBOHF genes in leaf tissues was revealed (Figures 2, ​,4),4), while their orthologous genes expression in Arabidopsis decreased (Pilarska et al., 2021).;  In E. salsugineum, thioredoxin CDSP32 was found to be higher in abundance than that in A. thaliana under control and salt-stress conditions (Figures 2, ​,4),4), and strongly diminished in salt-treated Arabidopsis plants (M'rah et al., 2007).;  Furthermore, the magnitude of electrolyte leakage and level of lipid peroxidation were modest in E. salsugineum, and very remarkable in Arabidopsis (M'rah et al., 2007).;  In contrast, the glycophyte Arabidopsis showed a decreased ascorbate content but increased lipophilic antioxidants (α-tocopherol, plastochromanol, and hydroxy-plastochromanol) due to 150 mM NaCl (Wiciarz et al., 2018).;  The redox states of plastoquinone (PQ) and P700 were differently regulated by salinity between the halophyte E. salsugineum and glycophyte A. thaliana, which was documented by effectively avoiding harmful singlet oxygen (1O2) in the PSII of Eutrema (Figures 2, ​,4),4), whereas an increased oxidation extent was observed in Arabidopsis (Wiciarz et al., 2018).;  Salt cress accumulated a markedly higher amount of proline than that of Arabidopsis under normal growth conditions, thus suggesting that the characteristic of extreme tolerance of salt cress to high salinity is due in part to the overaccumulation of proline under unstressed conditions (Taji et al., 2004; Figure 2).;  Likewise, Kant et al. (2006) demonstrated that E. salsugineum contained higher unstressed levels of proline than Arabidopsis, while under salt stress, Eutrema accumulated more proline mainly in shoots (Kant et al., 2006).; In summary, these presented data support the markedly higher basal metabolite levels (proline and secondary compounds) in E. salsugineum than Arabidopsis in normal growth conditions (Figure 2), which is an important characteristic of salt tolerance of salt cress plants.; The gene expression profiles in E. salsugineum (Shandong ecotype) using an Arabidopsis full-length cDNA microarray revealed that, in contrast to Arabidopsis, only a few genes were induced by 250 mM NaCl stress, and many known stress-inducible genes such as Fe-SOD, P5CS, PDF1.2, AtNCED, P-protein, b-glucosidase, and SOS1 were expressed at high levels in salt cress even in the absence of stress (Taji et al., 2004; Figure 2).;  The higher expression of the P5CS gene, encoding a key enzyme of proline biosynthesis, is in accordance with a much higher level of accumulated proline in salt cress than did Arabidopsis under normal growing conditions (Taji et al., 2004).;  Likewise, a comparison of transcript profiles between Arabidopsis at 150 mM NaCl and Eutrema (Shandong) exposed to 250 mM NaCl, using a microarray platform and Arabidopsis homologous gene probes, demonstrated that 40% shared and 60% distinguished regulated genes existed in the halophyte and the glycophyte (Gong et al., 2005).; Also, comparative proteomics of salt responses between A. thaliana and E. salsugineum revealed more changes in protein abundance in Arabidopsis than in Eutrema (Pang et al., 2010).; In addition, the cDNA microarray containing 3,628 stress-induced E. salsugineum (Yukon ecotype) unique sequences were used to investigate the gene expression-profiling between Yukon and Arabidopsis subjected to saline, simulated drought, and cold stress as well as recovery from water deficits.;  Importantly, E. salsugineum miR408 was strongly induced by 200 mM NaCl treatment, and Arabidopsis miR408 was induced by cold and mannitol, but not by salt (Liu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013).;  The higher expression of miR408 leads to improved tolerance to salinity, cold and oxidative stress in Arabidopsis (Ma et al., 2015).; In conclusion, these analyses of gene expression profiles based on the microarray platform and transcriptome in E. salsugineum provide useful global insight for elucidating the underlying salt tolerance mechanisms that distinguish it from Arabidopsis and help our more in-depth analyzing the extreme stress tolerance in this halophyte species.; In Arabidopsis, the PIPs (plasma membrane intrinsic proteins) aquaporins were well-characterized to be involved in the regulation of root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) (Javot et al., 2003; Tournaire-Roux et al., 2003).;  It has been reported that Arabidopsis PIP2;1 and PIP2;2 contribute to approximately 40% of the root hydraulic conductivity (Sutka et al., 2011; Péret et al., 2012), and the modification and localization of PIP aquaporins and root hydraulic conductivity could be regulated by the salt stress (Boursiac et al., 2008; Prak et al., 2008; Martinière et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2019).;  In all, the tonoplast AQP gene EsTIP1;2, was induced by multiple external stimuli, and a significantly elevated tolerance to salt, drought, and oxidative stress was observed in EsTIP1;2 transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Wang et al., 2014).;  Lee et al. (2013) found that, in E. salsugineum, 52 LEA protein sequences represented a high sequence similarity with the orthologs in Arabidopsis (Lee et al., 2013).;  In addition, the LEA protein gene EsLEA1 (TsLEA1, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU365627\",\"term_id\":\"166359607\",\"term_text\":\"EU365627\"}}EU365627) was characterized as a salt induced gene, and it could improve the survival of salt-sensitive yeast cells, as well as the salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants when ectopically expressed (Zhang et al., 2012; Table 1).;  Second, the transcriptional and metabolic comparisons of salt tolerant Eutrema and susceptible Arabidopsis pointed to a stress-anticipatory preparedness with constitutively high expression of the defense genes and relatively few salt-responsive genes detected, accompanied by preformed osmolyte of proline and secondary compounds, and lending metabolite configuration to fit osmoprotectant.\n",

is focused on G-quadruplex-forming sites in two gene sets of interest: drought stress-responsive genes, and genes related to the production/biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in the model plant organism Arabidopsis thaliana.; In this study, we decided to search for the PQS in two sets of a well-defined group of genes (the drought stress-responsive genes, and the genes of phenolic compounds synthesis pathways) to find out whether the PQS occurrence significantly varies from the average in the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome and also in comparison with the subset of constitutively expressed (housekeeping) genes.; FASTA files of the Arabidopsis thaliana drought stress-responsive genes (118 genes in total) obtained from the DroughtDB expert-curated database (https://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/droughtdb/drought_db.html, accessed on 24 July 2022) [21], phenolic compounds biosynthesis genes (30 genes in total), and housekeeping genes (20 genes in total), and FASTA files of their close surroundings 1000 bp upstream (+1000) and downstream (−1000) were acquired from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 30 July 2022).; In the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR 10, comprising five chromosomes, mitochondrial, and plastid DNA), a total of 41,557 PQS were found (Table 1).; PQS counts and frequencies in the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome.;  Red dashed horizontal lines indicate the mean PQS frequency (0.344 PQS per 1000 bp) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.;  The HRD gene encodes HRD Integrase-type DNA-binding superfamily protein, and its overexpression increases the density of the roots and improves water and salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana [24]. These genes could therefore have their regulation dependent on the formation of G4s.;  A similar trend is observable also in current data from Arabidopsis thaliana, where the frequency of 0.34 PQS per 1000 bp was found in nuclear DNA, a higher frequency of 0.81 in plastid DNA, and the highest frequency of 1.34 in mitochondrial DNA.;  While in algae and fungi the frequency of PQS in mtDNA is lower than in plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, in vertebrates the frequency of PQS in mtDNA is even significantly higher [26]. Although such large-scale predictions are computationally extensive, it would be beneficial to also inspect other higher plants in the future to see if this trend (frequency of PQS in nuclear DNA < frequency of PQS in plastid DNA < frequency of PQS in mitochondrial DNA) is always the same.;  These data should then be correlated with GC content as well because generally higher GC content may favor more PQS, although recently it was shown that genomes with a very similar GC content may differ significantly in their PQS frequencies [27]. Considering nuclear and plastid genomes which have very similar GC content in Arabidopsis thaliana, an explanation for different PQS frequencies may be found in significantly different gene densities.;  In addition, this article has shown that the PQS frequencies within the gene regions were generally higher than the average PQS frequency of the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome (comprising both genic and intergenic loci).; Our recent analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana further revealed that both the total number and frequencies of PQS within introns were very low (at least in three gene sets analyzed in this study), as only 10 PQS were found in these locations in total (8 in drought-responsive genes, 2 in housekeeping genes, and 0 in phenolic compounds synthesis genes).;  It is worth noting that the mean and median lengths of introns are only 168 bp, or 100 bp, respectively, in Arabidopsis thaliana (for comparison, in maize, the mean intron length is 516 bp and the median is 146 bp; and in humans, the mean intron length is 3356 bp and the median is 1023 bp) [28]. With such small intron sizes in Arabidopsis thaliana, PQS (usually 25 bp long) would span a substantial part of them, and maybe this is one of the reasons why they are depleted there—to avoid potential problems with RNA splicing.;  Nonetheless, in further studies, a whole genome of (not only) Arabidopsis thaliana could be analyzed by individual genes/gene sets and their features to gain an even more comprehensive picture of PQS distribution within functional units/pathways of genome and transcriptome.; One of the most interesting things found in this study is the fact that in all three gene sets analyzed, there were always slightly higher PQS frequencies in CDS than in the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome (mean PQS frequency).;  One of the first studies dealing with such problematics was published by Cho et al. [14], focusing on particular PQS in 5′-UTR regions of SMXL4 and SMXL5 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.;  It was observed that the formation of G4s within 5′-UTR of mRNA molecule (induced/stabilized by G4-binding protein JULGI) causes suppression of SMXL4/5 translation and restricts phloem differentiation [14]. Another work focused on a single PQS was published by Kwok et al. [31], where they identified PQS and corresponding G4 within the 5′-UTR of the ATR gene in Arabidopsis thaliana.\n",

 This shift is not due to substrate affinity (KM) but to pH dependence of catalytic turnover: The kcat of B. clausii cotA was 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8 in contrast to 6 s−1 at pH 6 and 2 s−1 at pH 8 for of B. subtilis cotA.;  While both proteins were heat activated, activation increased with pH and was larger in cotA from B. clausii.;  The B. clausii cotA had ∼20 minutes half-life at 80°C, less than the ∼50 minutes at 80°C for cotA from B. subtilis.;  While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at pH∼8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and alkali-resistance.; We found that the cotA from B. clausii has activity profiles shifted towards higher pH compared to B. subtilis cotA, notably for DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  This finding is in accordance with the optimal growth conditions of B. clausii.;  Both enzymes displayed substantial heat activation, as previously reported for B. subtilis spores [15], but for B. clausii cotA, the activation was much larger at higher pH.; The gene of B. clausii cotA (see sequence alignment in Figure S1 in File S1) was identified using protein BLAST with B. subtilis cotA as template against the genomic sequence of B. clausii KSM-K16.; The protein stability was investigated at 50°C and 70°C for the B. clausii and B. subtilis laccases in parallel, by incubating both enzymes at these temperatures and at pH 8, 9, or 10 for variable amounts of time. 200 µL laccase solutions in 20 mM buffer was incubated in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube on a temperature calibrated Eppendorf themomixer, and at different time points, 10 µL was retracted and immediately placed in a chilled 96-plate well with 90 µL milliQ water.; A Michaelis-Menten experiment was performed at pH 8.5 (∼pHopt for B. clausii cotA) using an apparent enzyme concentration of 1 nM.; \\nB. clausii KSM-16 encodes a cotA gene, has optimal growth at pH 9 at 40°C [38], compared to optimal growth at pH 8 for B. subtilis, suggesting a slightly higher alkaline tolerance.;  The M protease from B. clausii belongs to the high-alkaline subtisilin group with maximum activity at pH 12.3.;  These two biological observations suggest higher spore stability at higher pH values and prompted our cloning, expression, and characterization of B. clausii cotA.; \\nFigure 1A shows a sequence-derived nearest neighbor tree of homologous cotA enzymes created using MEGA 5.2 [43] started from the first 100 BLAST hits of B. clausii cotA against the Uniref90 database, and then reduced to only the high-scoring branches after a 1000-step bootstrap validation.;  It can be seen that the B. clausii cotA clusters together with a B. alcalophilus cotA in a different clade from that of B. subtilis cotA, showing a closer homology to this protein from an extremophilic bacteria.;  The B. clausii KSM-K16 cotA protein sequence was found to have 59% identity and 74% homology (BLOSUM62) with B. subtilis cotA, with most differences positioned within surface loops.;  The most notably difference between the two primary sequences is that B. clausii cotA lacks the cystine forming loop present in B. subtilis cotA.;

(B) The substrate binding pocket of cotA highlighting the differences between B. subtilis (green) and B. clausii (purple) cotA as described in the text.;  Amino acid changes are numbered on the B. subtilis cotA sequence and annotated with the B. clausii cotA amino acid last. (C) The water exit channel of cotA with similar highlighting.; \\nFigures 1B and 1C show the superpositions of a structure of B. clausii from homology modeling (purple) on the B. subtilis cotA structure 3ZDW [45], (green).;  The tertiary structure of B. clausii cotA was constructed with Phyre2 [46], giving a homology model that was overall similar in tertiary and secondary structure to structure 3ZDW of B. subtilis cotA.;  Two residues in contact with the substrate are substituted in B. clausii cotA; G417V and A227F, using the residue numbering from B. subtilis cotA.;  The pHopt∼7 is also consistent with that reported previously for B. subtilis cotA [35]. The notable difference between the two enzymes is that the laccase from B. clausii remains active at a higher pH than its ortholog from B. subtilis and keeps 50% of the activity at pH 9 at which the B. subtilis cotA displays almost no activity.; In terms of the phenolic substrate DMP (Figure 2C), we found an optimal turnover for B. subtilis cotA at pH∼7, which is in agreement with previously reported pHopt for this protein and substrate [35]. In contrast, the cotA from B. clausii was most effective above pH 8, showing a significant shift in pHopt (∼1.3) compared to the cotA from B. subtilis, further indicating enhanced alkalophilicity of the cotA from B. clausii.;  The pH activity profile (Figure 2D) shows an optimal pH shifting from 6 for B. subtilis cotA to 7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Similar to SGZ, the activity of B. clausii cotA broadens into the alkaline range with 40% activity at pH 8 compared to none for B. subtilis cotA.;  The laccase from B. clausii and B. subtilis were found to have slightly different pHopt shifting from ∼4.5 in B. subtilis cotA to ∼5 with B. clausii cotA.;  Tannic acids have been reported to inhibit tyrosinases [50]. The optimal pH activity profiles for oxidation of tannic acid (Figure 2G) are similar for both enzymes, with pH optima of ∼7.5±0.5, although the curve of B. clausii cotA shifted ∼0.5 pH units towards more alkaline conditions.;  First, promazine, ABTS, bilirubin, and to some extent phenylhydrazine and tannic acid show similar activity profiles vs. pH for the enzymes, with similar pHopt, despite some enhanced loss of B. clausii cotA activity at low pH for ABTS and phenylhydrazine.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  Interestingly, the pH optima follow the pKa values with 7, 7, and 8 for B. clausii cotA and 6, 6.6, and 7 for B. subtilis cotA, with a general trend of the B. clausii laccase being more active at higher pH.; A third trend, potentially related to the second one, is a shoulder in the activity profile in the pH range 8–9 for B. clausii cotA, which makes the activity profiles skewed towards higher pH.;  As this effect was seen for all the measured substrates that have activities in this pH range and since the effect did not follow the pKa of substrates, it suggests that B. clausii cotA has adapted to a generally more alkaline environment, consistent with an optimal growth at pH 9 of its host organism [38]. This non-substrate-specific activity effect coincides with the emerging OH− inhibition at above-neutral pH.;  B. clausii cotA has a glutamic acid (V110E) on the brim of the exit channel, which in itself, via electrostatic repulsion, might reduce OH− affinity for the channel, or it can possibly make an interaction with the other variable amino acid 427Q to reduce OH− entry during catalytic turnover.; In conclusion, the activity of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii is in some ways similar to that of the cotA from B. subtilis, but its increased pHopt and the broadened activity profiles up to 1–2 units higher pH for the phenolic substrates DMP, caffeic acid, and SGZ suggest a mechanism of alkali-tolerance that is explored further below.;  To investigate the stability of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii we first measured the activity of protein samples that had been stored in buffers at pH 3–10 and incubated at 30°C and 50°C for five hours (See Figure S4 and Figure S5 in File S1).;  From these experiments, the stability of B. subtilis cotA appears to be maximal in the range 7.6–8.6, while the B. clausii cotA shows a monotonic increase in activity as the pH becomes more alkaline.; To investigate the temperature behavior of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii in more detail, we studied its residual activity after incubation at various times at 50°C, 70°C, and 80°C, as described in the Methods section.;  This was especially prominent for B. clausii laccase and complicates the analysis of the thermostability.; (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. subtilis cotA at 80°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (E) B. clausii cotA at 70°C; (F) B. clausii cotA at 80°C.; Heat activation is visible at pH(circles, solid line), 9 (squares, broken line) and 10 (triangles, dotted line). (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 70°C.;  A similar fit was not possible for B. clausii due to its substantial heat activation but it is clear that its stability at pH 8 and 9 is slightly higher than at pH 10.;  Still, a plateau resulting from combined activation and degradation is visible within the first 20 minutes for both laccases except at pH 10 for cotA from B. clausii, which is degraded quickly at this high temperature.;  This compares well with the 56 minutes that can be read from the data in the original B. subtilis cotA characterization from 80°C incubation at pH 7.6 [15]. We estimated the corresponding t½(80°C) of B. clausii cotA to be ∼20 minutes at pH 8 and substantially less pH-dependent than cotA from B. subtilis.; From all measurements, B. clausii cotA had similar apparent stabilities in pH 8 and pH 9 and slightly lower stability in pH 10.;  A similar reading of B. clausii cotA at pH 9 gives 18%. These data thus show that the new cotA from B. clausii is slightly less thermostable than the cotA from B. subtilis, but has traded some of this thermostability for a higher stability at pH 9–10, whereas cotA from B. subtilis is found to be clearly most stable at pH 8.; From the short-time interval measurements shown in Figure 4, we can see that at 50°C, cotA from B. subtilis (Figure 4A) displayed no thermal activation at any pH whereas the laccase from B. clausii (Figure 4C) was activated three-fold within the first 300 minutes at pH 10, and two-fold at pH 8.;  The unusual, higher activation at higher pH for B. clausii cotA was consistent across the measured rates at pH 8, 9, and 10, and thus significant.;  At 70°C, the cotA from B. clausii (Figure 4D) displayed activation up to 220% within 20–40 minutes and then started to degrade.;  This heat-favored release may further be more pronounced in proteins with specific residues in the channels that favor anion release, such as the negative charge of B. clausii cotA.; \\nFigure 5 shows the activity (initial rates of SGZ product formation) of cotA from B. subtilis and B. clausii as a function of both NaCl concentration and pH.; (A) B. subtilis cotA; (B) B. clausii cotA; (C) Intersection at 400 mM NaCl and (D) intersection at 1000 mM NaCl, with B. clausii cotA in full lines and B. subtilis cotA in broken lines.;  From these figures, it is more clear that the cotA from B. subtilis loses activity quickly above pH 8, whereas the cotA from B. clausii preserves substantial activity at higher pH, consistent with the results from the activity profiles vs. pH, Figure 2.; Heat activation is common for laccases, but for B. clausii we also observed similar effect from high pH incubation and NaCl.;  The profiles were fitted with a Gaussian using a mean pH of 7.7 and an amplitude of 30.8 for B. subtilis cotA and 8.1 and 4.0 for B. clausii cotA, respectively.;  The ratios of the two parameters depend similarly on pH (Figure 6C), although the optimum for cotA from B. clausii is at ∼0.4 higher pH, as obtained from a Gaussian fitting.;  This finding confirms that the performance of cotA from B. clausii at higher pH is enhanced by activity associated with the copper sites, not the substrate binding step, and is consistent with an enhanced ability to prevent anion inhibition.;  The measured KM for B. clausii cotA was 1.02 mM, similar to cotA from B. pumilus with reported KM 0.822 mM towards DMP at pH 7 and 37°C [58].;  We accounted for this activation in the calculation of protein concentration and kcat for B. clausii using a factor of 3 as indicated by Figure 3 and used absorption at 600 nm for concentration estimation (File S1, Figure S8).;  The values of kcat deduced from the analysis (Figure 6) are for B. subtilis cotA ∼6 s−1 at pH 6 and ∼2 s−1 at pH 8 and for B. clausii cotA 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8.;  Moreover, since we performed the Michaelis-Menten analysis at various pH-values, we also observed that this inhibition is absent at acidic pH but initiates at pH∼6 for B. subtilis cotA and at pH∼7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Thus, the pH-dependence of the non-competitive inhibition is also consistent with the alkaline advantage of cotA from B. clausii.; We have reported the cloning, expression and characterization of a cotA from B. clausii, strictly benchmarked against its well-known ortholog from B. subtilis, expressed heterologously and characterized fully in parallel.;  We find that cotA from B. clausii has a shift in optimal pH for oxidation of phenolic substrates and a high salt resistance at high pH, compared to its ortholog from B. subtilis.; The stabilities of the two enzymes were substantial, with half-times of inactivation of 50 and 20 minutes for cotAs from B. subtilis and B. clausii, respectively, at pH 8 and 80°C.;  This advantage is, as shown in this work, further enhanced by the interplay of salt and pH at alkaline conditions where the cotA enzymes, in particular the cotA from B. clausii, work well.; The additional proficiency of cotA from B. clausii could be due to substitutions relative to its B. subtilis ortholog that may repel anion inhibitors in the water exit channel (notably V110E, Figure 1), although this requires further investigation, as does the complex interplay between pH and salt.; \\nFile S1 contains supporting data on sequence alignment of cotA orthologs (Figure S1), SDS page (Figure S2), activity profiles vs. pH without correcting for buffer differences and without subtraction of auto oxidation (Figure S3), data for pH-stability from activity measurements after incubation (Figure S4 and Figure S5), and data for the Michaelis Menten kinetics of cotAs from \\nB. subtilis\\n (Figure S6) and \\nB. clausii\\n (Figure S7).;  UV-VIS absorption profile of \\nB. clausii\\n cot A.

 This shift is not due to substrate affinity (KM) but to pH dependence of catalytic turnover: The kcat of B. clausii cotA was 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8 in contrast to 6 s−1 at pH 6 and 2 s−1 at pH 8 for of B. subtilis cotA.;  Overall, kcat/KM was 10-fold higher for B. subtilis cotA at pHopt.;  The B. clausii cotA had ∼20 minutes half-life at 80°C, less than the ∼50 minutes at 80°C for cotA from B. subtilis.;  While cotA from B. subtilis had optimal stability at pH∼8, the cotA from B. clausii displayed higher combined salt- and alkali-resistance.; We found that the cotA from B. clausii has activity profiles shifted towards higher pH compared to B. subtilis cotA, notably for DMP, SGZ, and caffeic acid.;  Both enzymes displayed substantial heat activation, as previously reported for B. subtilis spores [15], but for B. clausii cotA, the activation was much larger at higher pH.; The gene of B. clausii cotA (see sequence alignment in Figure S1 in File S1) was identified using protein BLAST with B. subtilis cotA as template against the genomic sequence of B. clausii KSM-K16.; The protein stability was investigated at 50°C and 70°C for the B. clausii and B. subtilis laccases in parallel, by incubating both enzymes at these temperatures and at pH 8, 9, or 10 for variable amounts of time. 200 µL laccase solutions in 20 mM buffer was incubated in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube on a temperature calibrated Eppendorf themomixer, and at different time points, 10 µL was retracted and immediately placed in a chilled 96-plate well with 90 µL milliQ water.;  We used the extinction coefficient as previously reported for B. subtilis cotA of 4000 M−1cm−1[40], which is similar to those of other bacterial laccases (e.g. 3900 M−1cm−1[19]), making this assignment robust.;  The impressive characteristics of B. subtilis cotA are surprising in the context of the native host being a mesophile, and we thus aimed at identifying orthologs from more extremophilic hosts.; \\nB. clausii KSM-16 encodes a cotA gene, has optimal growth at pH 9 at 40°C [38], compared to optimal growth at pH 8 for B. subtilis, suggesting a slightly higher alkaline tolerance.;  It can be seen that the B. clausii cotA clusters together with a B. alcalophilus cotA in a different clade from that of B. subtilis cotA, showing a closer homology to this protein from an extremophilic bacteria.;  The B. clausii KSM-K16 cotA protein sequence was found to have 59% identity and 74% homology (BLOSUM62) with B. subtilis cotA, with most differences positioned within surface loops.;  The most notably difference between the two primary sequences is that B. clausii cotA lacks the cystine forming loop present in B. subtilis cotA.;  Bootstrap values are given at the base of each branch. (B) The substrate binding pocket of cotA highlighting the differences between B. subtilis (green) and B. clausii (purple) cotA as described in the text.;  Amino acid changes are numbered on the B. subtilis cotA sequence and annotated with the B. clausii cotA amino acid last. (C) The water exit channel of cotA with similar highlighting.; \\nFigures 1B and 1C show the superpositions of a structure of B. clausii from homology modeling (purple) on the B. subtilis cotA structure 3ZDW [45], (green).;  The tertiary structure of B. clausii cotA was constructed with Phyre2 [46], giving a homology model that was overall similar in tertiary and secondary structure to structure 3ZDW of B. subtilis cotA.;  The two loops that are connected by the cystine bridge in B. subtilis cotA are generally similar for the two proteins, apart from the tight GCGGD turn that allows the cysteines to bind.;  Two residues in contact with the substrate are substituted in B. clausii cotA; G417V and A227F, using the residue numbering from B. subtilis cotA.; We first compare our obtained activity of the cotA from B. subtilis with previous work, in particular the pH optima with ABTS, SGZ, and DMP [15], [35]. As seen in Figure 2A, the ABTS oxidation rate of cotA from B. subtilis has maximum near pH∼4.;  This value is consistent with the pHopt(ABTS) of ∼4 obtained previously for cotA from B. subtilis\\n[35]. Furthermore, the activity behavior vs. pH is quite similar for the new cotA across the pH range, given similar pHopt for this substrate.;  The pHopt∼7 is also consistent with that reported previously for B. subtilis cotA [35]. The notable difference between the two enzymes is that the laccase from B. clausii remains active at a higher pH than its ortholog from B. subtilis and keeps 50% of the activity at pH 9 at which the B. subtilis cotA displays almost no activity.; In terms of the phenolic substrate DMP (Figure 2C), we found an optimal turnover for B. subtilis cotA at pH∼7, which is in agreement with previously reported pHopt for this protein and substrate [35]. In contrast, the cotA from B. clausii was most effective above pH 8, showing a significant shift in pHopt (∼1.3) compared to the cotA from B. subtilis, further indicating enhanced alkalophilicity of the cotA from B. clausii.;  The pH activity profile (Figure 2D) shows an optimal pH shifting from 6 for B. subtilis cotA to 7 for B. clausii cotA.;  Similar to SGZ, the activity of B. clausii cotA broadens into the alkaline range with 40% activity at pH 8 compared to none for B. subtilis cotA.;  The laccase from B. clausii and B. subtilis were found to have slightly different pHopt shifting from ∼4.5 in B. subtilis cotA to ∼5 with B. clausii cotA.; Second and in contrast, caffeic acid, SGZ, and DMP (and to some extent the polyphenol tannic acid) all have their active pH range increased for B. clausii cotA, compared to B. subtilis cotA.;  Interestingly, the pH optima follow the pKa values with 7, 7, and 8 for B. clausii cotA and 6, 6.6, and 7 for B. subtilis cotA, with a general trend of the B. clausii laccase being more active at higher pH.; In conclusion, the activity of the newly characterized cotA from B. clausii is in some ways similar to that of the cotA from B. subtilis, but its increased pHopt and the broadened activity profiles up to 1–2 units higher pH for the phenolic substrates DMP, caffeic acid, and SGZ suggest a mechanism of alkali-tolerance that is explored further below.;  From these experiments, the stability of B. subtilis cotA appears to be maximal in the range 7.6–8.6, while the B. clausii cotA shows a monotonic increase in activity as the pH becomes more alkaline.;  Again, we performed all measurements completely in parallel also for the cotA from B. subtilis, to enable a strict benchmark for characterization.; (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. subtilis cotA at 80°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (E) B. clausii cotA at 70°C; (F) B. clausii cotA at 80°C.; Heat activation is visible at pH(circles, solid line), 9 (squares, broken line) and 10 (triangles, dotted line). (A) B. subtilis cotA at 50°C; (B) B. subtilis cotA at 70°C; (C) B. clausii cotA at 50°C; (D) B. clausii cotA at 70°C.;  An attempt to fit an exponential decay to the B. subtilis cotA data is given in Figure 3B, where only the data after 120 minutes have been used in the fitting procedure.;  B. subtilis cotA show best stability at pH 8 with an approximate t½(70°C) of 250 minutes compared to 110 minutes at pH 9 and pH 10.;  The exponential decay function for B. subtilis cotA where the first 20 minutes have been disregarded in the fitting procedure is given in Figure 3C.;  This compares well with the 56 minutes that can be read from the data in the original B. subtilis cotA characterization from 80°C incubation at pH 7.6 [15]. We estimated the corresponding t½(80°C) of B. clausii cotA to be ∼20 minutes at pH 8 and substantially less pH-dependent than cotA from B. subtilis.;  In contrast, B. subtilis cotA exhibited highest apparent stabilities at pH 8.;  At pH 8 B. subtilis cotA has 30% activity after 100 minutes of incubation at 80°C.;  A similar reading of B. clausii cotA at pH 9 gives 18%. These data thus show that the new cotA from B. clausii is slightly less thermostable than the cotA from B. subtilis, but has traded some of this thermostability for a higher stability at pH 9–10, whereas cotA from B. subtilis is found to be clearly most stable at pH 8.; From the short-time interval measurements shown in Figure 4, we can see that at 50°C, cotA from B. subtilis (Figure 4A) displayed no thermal activation at any pH whereas the laccase from B. clausii (Figure 4C) was activated three-fold within the first 300 minutes at pH 10, and two-fold at pH 8.;  At an incubation temperature of 70°C, the cotA from B. subtilis began to display some thermal activation up to 140% at pH 10, but no activation at pH 8 (Figure 4B).; \\nFigure 5 shows the activity (initial rates of SGZ product formation) of cotA from B. subtilis and B. clausii as a function of both NaCl concentration and pH.; (A) B. subtilis cotA; (B) B. clausii cotA; (C) Intersection at 400 mM NaCl and (D) intersection at 1000 mM NaCl, with B. clausii cotA in full lines and B. subtilis cotA in broken lines.;  From these figures, it is more clear that the cotA from B. subtilis loses activity quickly above pH 8, whereas the cotA from B. clausii preserves substantial activity at higher pH, consistent with the results from the activity profiles vs. pH, Figure 2.;  However, activation has been observed up to 150% for natively expressed cotA in B. subtilis spores at 80°C [15], and activation up to 130% has been observed at 37°C for B. pumilius laccase [58], which is within the optimal temperature range for growth of the native host.; Introduction of a lysine into B. subtilis HR03 CotA [59] has been shown to significantly increase the potential heat activation to an extreme 900%. This was explained by the introduction of a new ionic interaction between two domains.;  The profiles were fitted with a Gaussian using a mean pH of 7.7 and an amplitude of 30.8 for B. subtilis cotA and 8.1 and 4.0 for B. clausii cotA, respectively.;  Our KM derived from non-linear fitting at pH 7 was 0.34 mM for cotA from B. subtilis, somewhat larger than the 0.23 mM determined by Durao et al. [40] As outlined in the supporting information (Figures S6 and S7 in File S1), DMP kinetics give rise to substrate inhibition.;  The values of kcat deduced from the analysis (Figure 6) are for B. subtilis cotA ∼6 s−1 at pH 6 and ∼2 s−1 at pH 8 and for B. clausii cotA 1 s−1 at pH 6 and 5 s−1 at pH 8.;  The reported kcat of B. subtilis cotA is in the lower end of the previously reported range 7–30 s−1 at pH 7 [40]. The kcat/KM curves generally follow the pH-dependent activities of Figure 2.;  The kcat/KM values resulting from Gaussian fitting (Figure 6) are 10-fold higher for B. subtilis cotA, suggesting that the alkali-salt tolerance discussed above has been achieved at the expense of catalytic proficiency.;  Moreover, since we performed the Michaelis-Menten analysis at various pH-values, we also observed that this inhibition is absent at acidic pH but initiates at pH∼6 for B. subtilis cotA and at pH∼7 for B. clausii cotA.; We have reported the cloning, expression and characterization of a cotA from B. clausii, strictly benchmarked against its well-known ortholog from B. subtilis, expressed heterologously and characterized fully in parallel.;  We find that cotA from B. clausii has a shift in optimal pH for oxidation of phenolic substrates and a high salt resistance at high pH, compared to its ortholog from B. subtilis.; The stabilities of the two enzymes were substantial, with half-times of inactivation of 50 and 20 minutes for cotAs from B. subtilis and B. clausii, respectively, at pH 8 and 80°C.; The additional proficiency of cotA from B. clausii could be due to substitutions relative to its B. subtilis ortholog that may repel anion inhibitors in the water exit channel (notably V110E, Figure 1), although this requires further investigation, as does the complex interplay between pH and salt.;  While this shift is consistent with higher alkali-salt tolerance and potentially explained by increased anion repulsion in the water exit channel, this tolerance has been at the expense of 10-fold lower kcat/KM (DMP) compared to cotA from B. subtilis.; \\nFile S1 contains supporting data on sequence alignment of cotA orthologs (Figure S1), SDS page (Figure S2), activity profiles vs. pH without correcting for buffer differences and without subtraction of auto oxidation (Figure S3), data for pH-stability from activity measurements after incubation (Figure S4 and Figure S5), and data for the Michaelis Menten kinetics of cotAs from \\nB. subtilis\\n (Figure S6) and \\nB. clausii\\n (Figure S7).\n",

the cloning, expression, and characterization of the bacterial cotA from Bacillus clausii, a supposed alkalophilic ortholog of cotA from B. subtilis.; This paper reports the cloning, expression in an E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and characterization of a previously uncharacterized cotA from the gram-positive Bacillus clausii KSM-K16.; The gene and linearized vector were purified with Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Illustra) and ligated with a T4 ligase (Fermentas) to yield the Bacillus clausii cotA expression vector p133.\n",

Comparative genomic analysis of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria sulphuraria predicts that the latter may be more broadly distributed in extreme environments because its genome contains membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds that are absent from C. merolae.;  Analysis of an endolithic site in the Phlegrean Fields near Naples, Italy is consistent with this prediction showing this population to be comprised solely of the newly described lineage Galdieria-B and C. merolae to be limited to humid habitats.;  C. merolae is absent from all endolithic and interlithic sites in Tuscany.; Among previously described Cyanidiales, members of the genus Galdieria are distributed among inter- and endolithic habitats in addition to diverse microhabitats including non-thermophilic sites [1,5,6,12-14]. This genus is heterotrophic and mixotrophic, can grow on more than 50 carbon sources, and tolerates a broad range of pH (0.5 – 6.0) and salinity (4 – 10%) [5,12]. The metabolic flexibility of Galdieria may explain why this genus can thrive in diverse environments in contrast to Cyanidioschyzon merolae which appears to be limited to humid habitats [6]. A recent comparative genomic analysis of these two species supports this view showing the presence of a large number of membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds in the Galdieria sulphuraria genome that are absent from C. merolae [15]. However there is no direct evidence from physiological studies in C. merolae to support these predictions based on genome analyses.;  As apparent in the tree G. maxima is clearly separated from the other Galdieria species (e.g., G. sulphuraria, G. daedala, and G. partita) and shows a close relationship to C. merolae.; The partial CaM coding region (nucleotides 58 – 283rd position in C. merolae) showed size variation (338 – 342 nt in length) in the SP-3 population (Galdieria-A).;  We included these sequences in phylogenetic trees (results not shown) and identified them as originating from G. suphularia (Galdieria-A; {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911434\",\"term_id\":\"62736087\",\"term_text\":\"AY911434\"}}AY911434, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911459\",\"term_id\":\"62736112\",\"term_text\":\"AY911459\"}}AY911459), G. maxima ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911496\",\"term_id\":\"62736149\",\"term_text\":\"AY911496\"}}AY911496), and C. merolae ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911454\",\"term_id\":\"62736107\",\"term_text\":\"AY911454\"}}AY911454).;  The most intriguing observation is of C. merolae from an endolithic site, which contrasts to the finding of our study at Pisciarelli and Tuscany.;  It is generally thought C. merolae would not survive in the endolithic environment because it lacks a cell wall and a vacuole which are crucial for maintaining and regulating turgor pressure and the osmotic potential [5,12,15]. In addition, the genome of this alga does not contain many membrane transporter genes which appear to be critical for heterotrophic growth; i.e., it encodes only one monosaccharide transporter [15,17]. However, the genome of C. merolae does encode all the metabolic enzymes required for heterotrophic growth (i.e., GlcMan and Gal; for details see reference [15]).;  These genomic features are generally consistent with (but do not prove) the idea that the ecophysiological characters of C. merolae make it an obligatory photoautotroph that is limited to humid microhabitats such as in Pisciarelli, Naples, Italy [6]. Consistent with the predicted dominance of C. merolae in humid environments, Ferris et al [16], in a 18S rDNA-based environmental survey in Nymph Creek were able to recover only this taxon out of 162 clones that were isolated from this acidic stream.;  Despite these promising data, it is clear that understanding the true limits to the distribution of C. merolae in nature will require future sampling of many other sites.\n",

sizes of 7.9, 9.6 and 6.7 Mbp, respectively.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T (Golinska et al. 2015), Actinospica robiniae DSM 44927T (Cavaletti et al. 2006), Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45618T and Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928T, were maintained on modified Bennett’s agar at pH 4.5 (Jones 1949) and as a mixture of hyphal fragments and spores in 20% w/v glycerol at − 20 and − 80 °C.; Genomic DNA was extracted from wet biomass of single colonies of isolate MGRD01-02T and A. durhamensis CSCA 57T which had been grown on acidified ISP 2 agar (pH 4.5), and on acidified R2A agar (Reasoner and Geldreich 1985), pH 4.5, for A puniceicyclus DSM 45618T for 7 days at 28 °C, using the protocol provided by MicrobesNG (Birmingham, UK) (http://www.microbesng.uk), and sequenced on an Miseq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, USA).;  Draft genome sequences of isolate MGDR01-02T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSOH000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2029756619\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSOH000000000\"}}JAGSOH000000000), A. durhamensis CSCA 57T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSOG000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2029756623\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSOG000000000\"}}JAGSOG000000000) and A. puniceicyclus DSM 45168T (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JAGSXH000000000\",\"term_id\":\"2032654651\",\"term_text\":\"JAGSXH000000000\"}}JAGSXH000000000) were generated following an established procedure undertaken by MicrobesNG (Birmingham, UK) (http://www.microbesng.uk) and sequenced on an MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, USA).; The accession numbers of the draft genomes are given in Table ​Table11 which also shows that the isolate and A. durhamensis CSCA 57T have large genomes, albeit ones lower than those of the type strains of A. acidiphila (9.6 Mbp, GenBank accession number NJ-JNYX 0000000), A. robiniae (9.9 Mbp, GenBank accession number NZ-{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AZAN00000000\",\"term_id\":\"563517757\",\"term_text\":\"AZAN00000000\"}}AZAN00000000) and C. acidiphila (10.5 Mbp, GCA—000024025).;  These data also show that the isolate is most closely related to A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44926T and most distantly to A. acidiphila NRRL B-24431T and C. acidiphila DSM 44928T.;  The isolate, for instance, can be separated from all of the other strains as it degraded hypoxanthine and grew at 45*C, and from A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, its nearest phylogenomic relatives, by its ability to use inulin as a sole carbon source and by an inability to produce α- and β-galactosidases, β-glucuronidase and cystine, leucine and valine arylamidases.;  Actinospica durhamensis CSCA 57T, 4.; Strain-specific BCCs included ones associated with the production of tiacumicin B (6% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound (Xiao et al. 2011), atratumycin (21% gene identity), an anti-tubercular antibiotic (Sun et al. 2019), auroramycin (11% gene identity), an antibiotic that actively inhibits Staphylococcus aureus (Duggar 2011), catenulipeptin (100% gene identity), a novel class III lantipeptide (Wang and Donk 2012), kirromycin (8% gene identity), an anti-bacterial compound active against Brevibacterium brevis (Wolf et al. 1972) and ristomycin A (10% gene identity), an antibiotic which inhibits mycobacteria (Fairbrother 1958) were characteristic of the genomes of isolate MGRD01-02T, A. puniceicyclus DSM 45618T, A. acidiphila DSM 44926T, C. acidiphila DSM 44928T, A. durhamensis CSCA 57T and A. robiniae DSM 44927T, respectively.\n",

              Before this developmental step, the cysts resembled a different snow alga, Chloromonas brevispina.;  Historically, this species was one of several lineages formerly assigned to Chloromonas brevispina, which comprised characteristic cysts with cells possessing uniformly distributed spiky surface structures (Hoham et al., 1979).\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                    The exposure to perchlorate induced at least partial inhibition of growth in all tested strains, although five of them were able to grow at the highest perchlorate concentration: Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, Leptolyngbya foveolarum, Arthronema africanum, Geitlerinema cf. acuminatum, and Cephalothrix komarekiana.;  Chroococcidiopsis sp.;  Chroococcidiopsis cubana demonstrated growth up to 0.5%. Strains that maintained growth displayed significantly increased malondialdehyde content, indicating perchlorate-induced oxidative stress, whereas the chlorophyll a/carotenoids ratio tended to be decreased.;  In particular, the unicellular polyextremophile Chroococcidiopsis sp. has been suggested as one of the most promising cyanobacteria for Mars exploration due to its resistance to multiple stressors that include desiccation, UV and ionizing irradiation, a wide range of temperatures, and low requirements for nutrients and light availability (Grilli Caiola et al., 1993; Friedmann and Ocampo-Friedmann, 1995; Billi and Grilli Caiola, 1996; Billi et al., 2000).; Moreover, a culture of Chroococcidiopsis sp. survived exposure to outer space for 548 days at the International Space Station (Cockell et al., 2011).;  However, in three strains that belonged to the genus Chroococcidiopsis, no differences were seen up to a 0.5% concentration.;  For the majority of cultures, the chlorophyll a/carotenoid ratio decreased, except for Chroococcidiopsis sp. and Myxosarcina sp. (HINDAK 1969/25), for which an increase was observed (Table 2).; As expected, cyanobacteria strains that belong to the order Chroococcidiopsidales demonstrated tolerance to perchlorates as previously shown for Chroococcidiopsis sp. (CCMEE 029) (Billi et al., 2021).;  Two other tested members of the genus Chroococcidiopsis, that is, Chroococcidiopsis sp. (HINDAK 1968/64) and C. cubana, thrived in a magnesium perchlorate concentration of up to 0.5%.; Previous studies have shown that different Chroococcidiopsis strains can differ in tolerance to various conditions such as desiccation, which is a feature related to their antioxidant system efficiency (Fagliarone et al., 2017).;  As previously shown, cyanobacteria that belong to the genera Leptolyngbya and Chroococcidiopsis are rich in flavonoids (Ijaz and Hasnain, 2016).;  Further, Chroococcidiopsis species have demonstrated the overexpression of genes encoding SODs under oxidative stress induced by desiccation (Napoli et al., 2021).; It was also experimentally shown that various strains of Chroococcidiopsis reveal different resistance to desiccation and radiation that correlates with avoidance of protein carbonylation, a marker for oxidative damage to proteins promoted by multiple reactive oxygen species (Fagliarone et al., 2017).;  The present study confirmed that Chroococcidiopsis species are highly resistant to perchlorate-induced oxidative stress and display no difference in intracellular MDA content after 14 days of exposure to concentrations of up to 0.5%.; Their accumulation in Chroococcidiopsis sp. has been previously associated with protection against the toxic effects of UVC exposure (Baqué et al., 2013b).;  Moreover, it was also shown that in Chroococcidiopsis sp., carotenoids are resistant to oxidation and subsequent degradation when exposed to high doses of gamma irradiation (Baqué et al., 2020).\n",

            "32  The atomic coordinates and the structure factors for Cyani HAP2 have been deposited in the PDB under the accession number 7S0K.;  Monomeric and trimeric Cyani HAP2 structures predicted with AlphaFold have been uploaded to Zenodo, accession code 6476359 with 10.5281/zenodo.6476359. Source data are provided in this paper.; Here, we study the gamete fusogen HAP2 from Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Cyani), an extremophile red algae that grows at acidic pH at 45 °C.;  The crystal structure of a monomeric prefusion state of Cyani HAP2 shows it is highly extended with three domains in the order D2, D1, and D3.;  Here, the authors present the crystal structure of a prefusion state of Cyanidioschyzon merolae HAP2 and low resolution structures of intermediates in the pathway to its trimeric postfusion state.;  Intermediates seen in this paper provide evidence for Cyani HAP2 that steps shown in a–c precede steps in d, e.;  We study HAP2 from Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Cyani), an extremophile, unicellular red alga adapted to high sulfur acidic hot spring environments that grows optimally at pH 1.5 and 45 °C9.;  Cyani HAP2 has unexpected features including an interim β-sheet in D1 that has not been seen in HAP2 postfusion structures or in any state of other class II fusion proteins.;  Hydrophobic environments in detergent micelles stimulate the formation of a trimeric, postfusion conformational state of Cyani HAP2.;  At intermediate values of pH 5.0, we were able to trap Cyani HAP2 in a trimeric state in which three rod-like molecules associate at the D2 end of the rod.; The Cyani HAP2 ectodomain (aa 28–564) was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells.;  A crystal structure of Cyani HAP2 to 2.3 Å resolution was solved by molecular replacement with the Chlamy postfusion HAP2 structure, and was refined to Rwork and Rfree values of 22.3 and 26.2%, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).;  Cyani HAP2 crystallizes as a monomer and has a rod-like shape with D3 in line with D2 and D1 (Fig. 2a).;  These differences are emphasized by the superimposition of one monomer of the Chlamy postfusion trimer on D1 of the prefusion state of Cyani HAP2 (Fig. 2c).; a Monomeric Cyani HAP2 shown as ribbon cartoon and colored by domain.;  The J0 β-strand and the linker between D1 and D3 are colored gold, and the C0D0 loop and C’ and C”O β-strands that form the interim β-sheet with the J0 strand are colored bluewhite. b The structure of postfusion, trimeric Chlamy HAP2, with chain A colored as in a and chains B and C as transparent solvent-accessible surfaces. c Comparison of the HAP2 trimeric (Chlamy) and monomeric (Cyani) states after superposition on D1 using DeepAlign23. d SEC-MALS of monomeric Cyani HAP2 at pH 7.5 (blue curve) and trimeric Cyani HAP2 formed at pH 1.5 with DDM (red curve).;  Molar masses of the protein, glycan, glycoprotein, and β-DDM components as shown. e–g Fusion loops FL1(190–198), FL2 (209–214), and FL3 (143–149) shown in stick with black mesh showing the 2Fo–Fc map contoured at 1σ. h–j HAP2 D2.2 of Cyani (h) and Chlamy (i) alone and superimposed (j).;  Cyani and Chlamy HAP2 have pink and cyan fusion loop residue sticks and light green and silver cartoon backbones, respectively. k, l Cyani (k) and Chlamy HAP2 (l) D1 after structural alignment with same coloring as in a.; Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) showed that Cyani HAP2 was monomeric in solution (Fig. 2d).;  PISA assembly analysis of the Cyani HAP2 crystal structure showed that no significant interactions with other monomers were present in the crystal lattice and thus that Cyani HAP2 was monomeric at high concentrations in crystals as well as in solution.;  These results show that Cyani HAP2 crystallized as a monomeric state distinct from the previous trimeric, postfusion state HAP2 structures5–7.; Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the monomeric state of Cyani characterized here is a prefusion state.;  Unlike more divergent viral class II fusion proteins, HAP2 proteins in different species are not only structurally homologous, but also in sequence1,4–7, e.g., as for HAP2 of the red alga Cyani and the green alga Chlamy (Fig. 3).;  The Chlamy HAP2 ectodomain, like that of Cyani HAP2, is a monomer in solution; however crystals have only revealed its trimeric postfusion state4–6.;  To test whether Cyani HAP2 could trimerize in the presence of a hydrophobe that mimicked a membrane environment, we incubated it with DDM at the physiologically relevant Cyani growth pH of 1.5.;  This treatment stimulated formation of Cyani HAP2 trimers that bound to DDM micelles (Fig. 2d).;  As Cyani and Chlamy HAP2 are orthologues, each with ectodomains that are metastable monomers in solution that form postfusion state trimers in the presence of detergents, we conclude that the monomeric state seen in the Cyani HAP2 crystal structure is a prefusion state.; The fusion loops of Cyani HAP2 locate to the membrane distal end of D2 (Fig. 2a).;  Cyani FL1 and FL2 each contain multiple, putative, hydrophobic fusion loop residues (Fig. 2h and Fig. 3).;  Cyani HAP2 also has putative hydrophobic fusion loop residues in the first portion of the long βb-βc loop, which we designate FL3 (Fig. 2h and Fig. 3).;  Most of the FL1 and FL2 fusion loop residues in Chlamy are conserved as hydrophobic residues in Cyani (Fig. 3).;  However, the conformations of fusion loops differ in Cyani and Chlamy, likely for two reasons (Fig. 2h–j).;  FL1 and FL2 are four and six residues shorter in Cyani than in Chlamy (Fig. 3), respectively, and thus necessarily differ in loop conformation.;  D2.2 is stabilized by a single, thin β-sheet with the b, d, and c β-strands and five disulfide bonds that are conserved in Cyani and Chlamy HAP2 (Fig. 3).;  Using DeepAlign, intact pre and postfusion monomers were aligned with D1 to monomeric Cyani HAP2.; β-DDM detergent stimulates Cyani HAP2 to form trimers at the physiological growth pH, 1.5, as described above (Fig. 2d).; a Size exclusion chromatography of Cyani HAP2 treated with or without β-DDM at indicated pH values at 37 °C for 26 h.;  Profiles are separated from one another by successive increases of 20 A280 mAU on the y axis. b–e Representative class averages of Cyani HAP2 treated as shown above each panel.; Gel filtration peaks of Cyani HAP2 samples treated with or without β-DDM at different pH values and for differing lengths of time at 37 °C were subjected to negative-stain EM (Fig. 5b–e).; The Cyani HAP2 monomer at pH 7.5 in absence of β-DDM is extended and linear in shape, with four distinct densities spanning 155 to 159 Å, and cross-correlates well with the Cyani HAP2 crystal structure (Fig. 5b).; The Cyani HAP2 trimer formed at pH 2.0 was shorter and wider than monomeric HAP2 (Fig. 5c).;  These observations show that the Cyani HAP2 ectodomain can form a postfusion trimer structure in an acidic environment when a hydrophobe is present.; To test whether we could identify intermediates in the formation of the postfusion state, we incubated Cyani HAP2 with β-DDM at pH 5.0 for 2 or 26 h and subjected it to gel filtration and negative-stain EM.;  After 2 h in presence of β-DDM, branched dimers and trimers were present but were rarer than seen with Cyani HAP2 at pH 5 at 2 h, and postfusion-like trimers were also present (Fig. 6b).; To test the prediction that monomers were associating at their D2.2 end rather than their D3 end, and to further study intermediates, we deleted D3 from Cyani HAP2.;  The resulting Cyani HAP2 D1D2 construct was well expressed.;  Negative-stain EM showed that some Cyani HAP2 D1D2 remained monomeric after β-DDM treatment at pH 5.0, with three clear densities corresponding to D2.2, D2.1, and D1 (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Figure 5).; a Representative class average of Cyani HAP2 D1D2 at pH 5.0 in 0.1% β-DDM after 26 h at 37 °C. b Representative class averages of Cyani HAP2 D1D2 at pH 1.5 in 0.1% β-DDM after 26 h at 37 °C.; We measured the thermal stability of Cyani HAP2 as a function of pH using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 8a).;  Cyani HAP2 was stable over a broad pH range from 1.5 to 7.5, with midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm) values of 54–65 °C, with onset values of denaturation at >43 °C, higher than the temperature of 37 °C at which we measured trimerization stimulated by DDM.;  SDS-PAGE of Cyani HAP2 wild type and mutant ectodomains protein was conducted three times with essentially identical results. c–j Size exclusion chromatography of Cyani HAP2 wild type and mutant ectodomains treated with or without 0.1% DDM in buffers at the indicated pH values for the indicated times at 37 °C and subjected to size exclusion chromatography in buffers of the indicated pH values in absence or presence of 0.01% DDM, respectively.; We next examined the effect of fusion loop mutations on trimer formation by the Cyani HAP2 ectodomain.;  Trimerization of the WT Cyani HAP2 ectodomain was complete at pH 4.3 both after 2 and 4 h in DDM (Fig. 8f–h).; To obtain a model of the postfusion state of Cyani HAP2, we used AlphaFold-Multimer12.;  Compared to the Cyani crystal structure (Fig. 9a), the model was remarkably accurate, contained the interim β-sheet, and had Cα atom RMSDs of 0.5 to 0.6 Å for individual D1, D2, and D3 domains and an RMSD of 3.4 Å over all 466 residues of the prefusion state (Fig. 9b).;  Predictions of monomeric structures of Chlamy and A. thaliana HAP2 yielded postfusion-like conformations with a hairpin bend between D1 and D3, perhaps influenced by their deposited trimeric structures in the PDB, in contrast to the extended prefusion-like conformation of Chlamy HAP2 seen in EM here and predicted by AlphaFold for Cyani HAP2.; a Crystal structure of monomeric Cyani HAP2 structure.;  Interim β-sheet β-strands are colored gold (J0) and bluewhite (C’0 and C”0 and their loop). b, c Monomeric Cyani HAP2 (b) and trimeric Cyani HAP2 (c) structures predicted by AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer, respectively.;  The AlphaFold trimer model is shown with green backbone and hotpink fusion loop residues in stick superimposed on the Cyani Hap2 crystal structure (d) and the Chlamy Hap2 crystal structure (e) with silver backbone and cyan fusion loop residues.;  The Cyani HAP2 monomer was predicted by AlphaFold13 Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb]. The Cyani HAP2 trimer was predicted with AlphaFold-Multimer12 (https://github.com/deepmind/AlphaFold), run on the cosmic server [https://cosmic2.sdsc.edu:8443/gateway/home.action]. See Supplementary Figure 6 for prediction reliability.; When challenged to predict a trimeric Cyani HAP2 structure, AlphaFold-multimer produced a postfusion-like conformation with a hairpin bend between D1 and D3 (Fig. 9c).;  Interestingly, the conformation of FL1 became very similar to that seen in the postfusion state of Chlamy HAP2, with the four-residue shortening of FL1 in Cyani relative Chlamy (Fig. 3) accommodated by a shortening of the α1-helix (Fig. 9e).;  Cyani HAP2 shows important differences from viral class II fusion proteins.; The prefusion state of Chlamy HAP2, like Cyani HAP2, was found to be monomeric in solution4,5.;  Cyani HAP2 also behaved like a monomer in the crystal lattice, with no biologically relevant associations with other monomers.;  The monomeric state of Cyani HAP2 in solution and crystals suggests that in the absence of a hydrophobic environment, such as provided by a detergent here, it does not multimerize.; The prefusion state of Cyani HAP2 is unusually extended compared to prefusion states of structurally homologous viral class II fusogens.;  Furthermore, both Chlamy and Cyani HAP2 exhibited extended prefusion states with four globules in the rod, consistent with the subdivision of domain 2 into D2.1 and D2.2 subdomains.; A unique feature of the Cyani HAP2 prefusion state is the presence of an interim β-sheet in D1 that is separate from the two β-sheets in D1 that form the β-sandwich.;  The J0 β-strand in the Bunyavirus prefusion state is present in an interim β-sheet, but it differs from that in Cyani HAP2 in associating with A0-like and B0-like β-strands rather than β-strands that form between the C0 and D0 strands.;  The J0 β-strand in Bunyavirus also differs in orientation by ~90°. In the postfusion state, the Bunyavirus interim β-sheet disappears, and the J0 β-strand forms a linker on the opposite side of D1 from the J0 β-strand in the Chlamy and predicted Cyani HAP2 postfusion states, consistent with D3 hairpin formation on the opposite side of D1 from Cyani HAP2 (Fig. 4b, e).;  Identification of these intermediates was facilitated by slowing formation of the postfusion state of Cyani HAP2 at pH 5.;  Cyani HAP2 lacking D3 also formed postfusion state-like trimers; formation of branched dimers and trimers by this construct further showed that monomers associate at the tip of D2.2.; Cyani HAP2 amino acid sequence numbering is from RefSeq accession {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"XP_005536505.1\",\"term_id\":\"544212714\",\"term_text\":\"XP_005536505.1\"}}XP_005536505.1.;  Codon-optimized synthetic cDNA encoding Cyani HAP2 ectodomain (residues 28–564) was cloned into a modified Drosophila S2 expression ET15S2 vector with a C-terminal His-tag and transfected into Drosophila melanogaster Schneider S2 cells (ExpreS2 cells, ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies), using EXpreS2 transfection reagent.;  Cyani HAP2 D1D2 (residues 28–457) constructs and Cyani HAP2 ectodomain (residues 28–564) fusion loop mutants (FL1: L194A, L195A, L197A; FL2: L210A, L211A, F213A; FL3: W147A, L148A; and combinations of all in FL123) and WT control constructs were cloned into PD2529 expression vector (ATUM) with a C-terminal His-tag for expression in ExpiF293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 0.8 mg plasmid was incubated with 0.8 mL FectoPRO (Polyplus) in Opti-MEM (Gibco) for 10 min at room temperature and then added to 1 L of Expi293 cells cultured in Expi293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 24 hrs after transfection, valproic acid and glucose were added to the culture to final concentrations of 3 mM and 0.4% w/v, respectively.;  Yields for S2 expression of the Cyani HAP2 ectodomain were 1.5–2 mg/L culture supernatant.;  Yields for transiently expressed Cyani HAP2 D1D2 was 3–4 mg/L culture supernatant.; Crystals were grown at 20 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion with equal volumes of Cyani HAP2 ectodomain (5–6 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (19% isopropanol, 19% PEG3350, 5% glycerol, 0.1 M pH 6.4 sodium citrate).; Purified Cyani HAP2 monomer or Cyani HAP2 D1D2 (10–15 mg/ml, 50 μL) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl was incubated with 450 μL of buffers described below in presence of 0.1% β-DDM, 500 mM NaCl at 37 °C for varying times.; To test the effect of fusion loop mutations on trimer formation in gel filtration, WT and mutant Cyani HAP2 ectodomains (16 μM) were incubated with nine volumes of 50 mM citric acid-trisodium citrate buffers at pH 4.7, 4.3, or 3.5, 500 mM NaCl with or without DDM at 37 °C for varying times and gel filtered as described above.;  Selected 2D class averages of Cyani HAP2 trimer were masked and cross-correlated with 2D projections generated at 2° intervals from electron density maps filtered to 25 Å of Chlamy HAP2 trimer crystal structure (PDB ID: 6DBS) or hexamer formed by trimers interacting through fusion loops in the crystal lattice.; Cyani HAP2 monomer or trimer was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using an Agilent liquid chromatography system equipped with a DAWN HELEOS II multi-angle light scattering detector, an Optilab T-rEX refractive index detector, and UV detector (Wyatt Technology Corporation).;  For Cyani HAP2 monomer, dn/dc values of 0.185 and 0.145 ml/g were used for protein and glycan, respectively26,27, and A280 extinction coefficient of 1.411 ml mg−1 cm−1 was calculated from amino acid sequence.;  For Cyani HAP2 trimer, dn/dc value of 0.133 was used for the β-DDM component28.;  We calculated the dn/dc value (0.181) of the glycoprotein component of the trimer by using the weight fraction of protein (fprot=0.877) and glycan (fglycan= 0.123) of the Cyani HAP2 monomer as dndcglycoprot=dndcprot*fprot+dndcglycan*fglycan, described in5.;  Similarly, the extinction coefficient for the of Cyani HAP2 monomer is 1.237 ml mg−1 cm−1glycoprotein, which was calculated as εglycoprot=εprot*fprot+εglycan*fglycan.; Cyani HAP2 ectodomain purified from Expi293F cells (20 mg/mL in 1 μL 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl was diluted with 19 μL of buffers containing 500 mM NaCl and the following: 50 mM HCI-KCI (pH 1.5 and pH 2.0), citric acid-trisodium citrate (pH 3.5, pH 4.3, and pH 5.0), or Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).;  Debora Marks and Joseph Min for helping with an earlier AlphaFold prediction of the trimeric Cyani HAP2 structure.; The atomic coordinates and the structure factors for Cyani HAP2 have been deposited in the PDB under the accession number 7S0K.;  Monomeric and trimeric Cyani HAP2 structures predicted with AlphaFold have been uploaded to Zenodo, accession code 6476359 with 10.5281/zenodo.6476359. Source data are provided in this paper.\n",

environments because its genome contains membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds that are absent from C. merolae.; Among previously described Cyanidiales, members of the genus Galdieria are distributed among inter- and endolithic habitats in addition to diverse microhabitats including non-thermophilic sites [1,5,6,12-14]. This genus is heterotrophic and mixotrophic, can grow on more than 50 carbon sources, and tolerates a broad range of pH (0.5 – 6.0) and salinity (4 – 10%) [5,12]. The metabolic flexibility of Galdieria may explain why this genus can thrive in diverse environments in contrast to Cyanidioschyzon merolae which appears to be limited to humid habitats [6]. A recent comparative genomic analysis of these two species supports this view showing the presence of a large number of membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds in the Galdieria sulphuraria genome that are absent from C. merolae [15]. However there is no direct evidence from physiological studies in C. merolae to support these predictions based on genome analyses.;  The trees inferred from the latter two analyses share a very similar topology with the ML-all tree (Fig. ​(Fig.2),2), except for the monophyletic clade composed of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria maxima that is positioned with the Galdieria-A + -B lineage in the ML-protein tree.;  The internal topology of the Cyanidiales indicates a division into four lineages [6]; 1) Galdieria spp. (Galdiera-A and -B lineages, excluding Galdieria maxima), 2) Cyanidium caldarium, 3) mesophilic Cyanidium sp., and 4) Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria maxima.;  Cyanidioschyzon merolae, which lacks introns in the CaM gene (CMK219C from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project), was used to determine the sites of intron insertion.; The Cyanidiales provide an untapped resource for understanding adaptations at the genomic level to life in extreme environments with one complete genome sequence already available (Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D) [15,17] and another that is nearly finished (Galdieria sulphuraria 074G) [18]. The Cyanidiales are unique in their ability as eukaryotes to thrive under extreme conditions at hot springs (temperatures between 50° – 55°C, pH between 0.5 – 3.0) [5-8,19]. These single-celled, photosynthetic red algae also have the ability to grow under low light conditions in endolithic habitats (see Fig. ​Fig.1)1) [1,4,6]. It is rare for eukaryotes to live beneath the rock surface, although endolithic prokaryotic communities have often been found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts, hot spring, and arctic regions) [3,4]. Endolithic Cyanidiales were first reported from Pisciarelli and La Solfatara near Naples, Italy [1]. These authors assumed, based on gross morphology (i.e., cell size from SEM images, see Fig. ​Fig.33 in Gross et al. [1]) that the endolithic Cyandiales were species of Cyanidium and Galdieria.;  It is surprising, despite our low sample size, that we did not identify other Cyanidiales species (i.e., Cyanidioschyzon merolae, Galdieria-B, and G. maxima) at the Larderello sites.;  Four novel degenerate primers were designed to amplify the CaM gene based on available data from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project [22] and the Galdieria sulphuraria Genome Project [23] (with the aid of A.\n",

viscosity during desiccation compared to untransfected control cells.;  The sequence features of AfLEA1 have been investigated using bioinformatics, and in vivo experiments have been performed by transfecting E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells with AfLEA1 variants [13,17]. In these experiments, no improvements in osmotic stress tolerance could be detected for E. coli, and modest improvements in viability after freezing and drying were observed in yeast [13]. Similar observations were made after expressing a mitochondrial-targeted AfLEA1 variant from A. franciscana in Kc167 cells from D. melanogaster.; Kc167 cells from D. melanogaster ectopically co-expressing AfLEA1-mCherry and GFP were stained with MitoView Blue and imaged using confocal microscopy.; A chimeric protein composed of AfLEA1 and mCherry localizes predominately to the cytoplasm in D. melanogaster Kc167 cells ectopically co-expressing AfLEA1-mCherry and GFP (Examples 1 and 2).\n",

                 Accumulation of intracellular Mn2+ complexing with small metabolites is the key contributor to the tolerance of D. radiodurans against oxidative stress.;  However, the intracellular reservoir of Mn ions and homeostatic regulation of the Mn complex in D. radiodurans remain unclear.;  We identified an evolutionarily ancient and negatively charged phosphate polymer (polyphosphate [PolyP]) in D. radiodurans.;  We investigated PolyP metabolism in the response of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.;  The genes dr1939, encoding polyphosphatase kinase (PPKDr; the subscript “Dr” refers to D. radiodurans), and dra0185, encoding exopolyphosphatase (PPXDr), were identified.;  Hence, dynamic cellular PolyP metabolites complexed with free Mn ions highlight a defense strategy of D. radiodurans in response to oxidative stress.;  We found that PPXDr (the subscript “Dr” refers to D. radiodurans) is a novel exopolyphosphatase with a cofactor preference for Mn2+, mediating PolyP-Mn degradation into Pi and Mn ions.;  The dynamic PolyP metabolism coordinating with Mn ions is a defense strategy of D. radiodurans in response to oxidative stress.;  The findings not only provide new insights into the resistance mechanism of the extreme bacterium D. radiodurans but also broaden our understanding of the functions of PolyP metabolism in organisms.;  D. radiodurans contains a particularly high level of intracellular Mn2+ that is approximately 100 times higher than that of radiosensitive Escherichia coli when grown in a defined minimal medium, and the dominant form of Mn in D. radiodurans cells is Mn2+ (7).;  These results indicate that Mn complexes with small metabolites are important for the D. radiodurans defense against oxidative stress.;  However, the intracellular reservoir and homeostatic regulation of the Mn complex in D. radiodurans under oxidative stress remain unknown.;  We have found the presence of PolyP in D. radiodurans.; In the present study, we investigated the enzymes involved in PolyP metabolism in D. radiodurans.;  The PPXDr-mediated PolyP metabolites complexed with Mn ions were investigated to reveal the relationship between PolyP metabolism and Mn-dependent stress resistance in D. radiodurans.; The genome of D. radiodurans R1 was screened for genes encoding PPK and PPX homologs by using the BLASTP program (NCBI, https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and using the established E. coli PPK and E. coli PPX, respectively, as query sequences.;  The putative PPK- and PPX-encoding genes found in the D. radiodurans genome are dr1939 and dra0185 (see Fig.;  S1 in the supplemental material) and were tentatively designated ppkDr and ppxDr (the subscript “Dr” refers to D. radiodurans), respectively.;  However, no endopolyphosphatase (PPN) homologs were found in D. radiodurans.; To determine whether dr1939 and dra0185 correspond to the ppk and ppx of D. radiodurans, mutants of dr1939 and dra0185 (ΔppkDr mutant and ΔppxDr mutant, respectively) were constructed and verified (see Fig.;  The living cells of D. radiodurans were stained by DAPI (green for PolyP-DAPI and blue for DNA-DAPI) and Synapse C1 (red for membrane).; Identification of polyphosphate kinase (PPKDr) and exopolyphosphatase (PPXDr) in D. radiodurans. (A) Fluorescence microscopic detection of PolyP in cells in the absence (untreated) or presence of 30 mM H2O2 treatment.;  S3 in the supplemental material), confirming that dr1939 encodes PPK in D. radiodurans (PPKDr).;  Purified DRA0185 was able to degrade PolyP in vitro (Fig. 1D), indicating that DRA0185 acts as a PPX in D. radiodurans (PPXDr).;  Previous reports showed that some proteins like beta-lactamases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and RNase J (D. radiodurans) can be converted into dimers in the presence of metal ions (34, 35).;  The ΔppxDr mutant was more sensitive to H2O2 than the wild-type R1, whereas the gene complemented the mutant phenotype in strain ΔppxDr/C-ppxDr resulting in resistance like the wild-type R1 (Fig. 3A and ​andB),B), suggesting that the exopolyphosphatase PPXDr and PolyP degradation products might be involved in the resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.;  On the other hand, the ΔppkDr mutant displayed increased resistance to H2O2, indicating that blocked PolyP synthesis results in a surplus of intracellular Pi that might lead to strong resistance in D. radiodurans.;  These results indicate that PolyP metabolites were involved in the resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.; PolyP metabolites are involved in cell resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress. (A) Survival assay of the wild-type R1 and mutant cells exposed to 50 mM H2O2.; Small metabolites complexed with Mn ions, e.g., Mn-phosphate (Mn-Pi) and Mn-carbonate, act as efficient ROS scavengers in D. radiodurans (8).;  Mn2+ is the key factor for oxidative stress resistance in D. radiodurans (1); however, Mn2+ chelated by PolyP might fail to detoxify free radicals and protect proteins (14).;  A previous study demonstrated that the Mn2+ in D. radiodurans could be complexed with small molecules, such as PO43−, amino acids, or nucleosides, to defend against free radicals (5).; Ex vivo protection of cells by PolyP products with Mn2+ against oxidative stress. (A) Effects of PolyP(P100) or PolyP(P100) mixed with Mn2+ on the survival of D. radiodurans cells treated with 80 mM H2O2.;  Different dilutions of cell cultures are indicated in the figure. (B) Effects of PolyP(P100) or PolyP-Mn degradation product (Mn-Pi) using PPXDr on the survival of D. radiodurans cells treated with 80 mM H2O2. (C) The nonenzymatic O2− scavenging activity assay of PolyP-Mn complex and Mn-Pi products by PPXDr.; To determine how PolyP accumulates and decomposes in D. radiodurans under oxidative stress, the time course profile of PolyP level as well as expression levels of ppkDr and ppxDr were measured in the cells under H2O2 treatment.;  Moreover, the levels of intracellular ROS and protein carbonylation exhibited similar profiles as those of PolyP (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the PolyP metabolites were involved in the oxidative stress response of D. radiodurans.;  The dynamic expression profiles of ppkDr and ppxDr in response to oxidative stress might be a defense strategy in the resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.; In the present study, we identified the polyphosphate kinase (PPKDr) and exopolyphosphatase (PPXDr) in D. radiodurans, which is known for its resistance to oxidative stress.; D. radiodurans can accumulate as much as 30 mM Mn ions (42), and the most common state of Mn in cells is Mn2+ (43).;  Our results demonstrate that PolyP metabolites complexed with Mn ions are involved in the cell resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.;  The cells of the ΔppxDr mutant containing high levels of PolyP generated more ROS, while the ΔppkDr mutant had less ROS than the wild type following treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that exopolyphosphatase PPXDr and PolyP degradation products are involved in the resistance of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress.;  Third, the PolyP from the ΔppxDr mutant contains approximately three times the amount of Mn ions compared with the wild type, while the PolyP-binding Mn in the ΔppkDr mutant was negligible (Fig. 3D), inferring the role of PolyP in effectively chelating free Mn ions and facilitating the accumulation of Mn ions as an “Mn pool” in D. radiodurans.;  We did not exclude the possibility that Mn2+ in D. radiodurans could be complexed with other small molecules such as amino acids and nucleosides to form Mn-antioxidants as described in previous studies (7, 44).;  However, PolyP metabolites complexed with Mn ions indeed contribute greatly to the oxidative stress resistance of D. radiodurans.; PolyP metabolites mediated by PPKDr and PPXDr in D. radiodurans may have dual functions, as follows: direct protein-binding chaperone activity of PolyP (13), Mn homeostasis regulation, and Mn-Pi generation for ROS scavenging.;  This contrast could be because D. radiodurans is a bacterium with a high level of Mn accumulation, which would invalidate the protective effect of PolyP on proteins.; A model of PolyP metabolism coordinating with Mn ions in the response of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress is proposed (Fig. 7).; Proposed scheme of PolyP metabolism coordinating with Mn ions in the response of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress. (A) Cells under nonstress conditions; the PolyP metabolism is in equilibrium which is regulated by PPKDr and PPXDr.; In conclusion, the coordination of PolyP metabolism and Mn ions is an adaptive strategy of D. radiodurans to cope with oxidative stress.;  Our findings not only provide new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the extreme bacterium D. radiodurans but also broaden our understanding of the functions of PolyP metabolism in organisms under oxidative stress.;  D. radiodurans strains were grown at 30°C in tryptone, glycose, and yeast extract (TGY) medium (0.5% tryptone, 0.1% glucose, and 0.3% yeast extract) with aeration or on TGY plates supplemented with 1.5% Bacto-agar.;  After digestion, fragments were ligated to a kanamycin resistance fragment, and the amplified ligation product was transformed into D. radiodurans.;  The PCR product was then purified using a Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system kit (Promega Co., USA) and transformed into the D. radiodurans R1 strain using the CaCl2 method (46).;  Competent cells of D. radiodurans were obtained as follows: the wild-type R1 strain was cultured in TGY broth to an OD600 of 0.8, and then the cells collected by centrifugation were rinsed three times and cultured using 4× TGY containing 60 mM CaCl2 for 2 h.; D. radiodurans wild-type R1 and mutant strains were cultured in TGY broth to an OD600 of 1.0.; The gene encoding PPXDr or PPKDr was amplified from the D. radiodurans R1 genome (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CP015081.1\",\"term_id\":\"1026245073\"}}CP015081.1) and cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) for generating a fusion protein with an N-terminal (His)6 tag.;  The commercial anti-GroEL was used to detect GroEL in D. radiodurans (46).\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                In contrast, double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses feature a much broader diversity of DNA replication machineries.;  We identified and analyzed all major functional groups of DNA replication proteins in all available proteomes of dsDNA viruses.; DNA replication systems in dsDNA viruses are even more diverse than those of their cellular hosts.;  First, dsDNA viruses differ according to the sets of DNA replication proteins encoded in their genomes.;  Second, compared to cellular organisms, dsDNA viruses employ a larger number of evolutionary solutions for at least some of the DNA replication steps.;  Are there novel assortments of DNA replication proteins in new viruses identified by genomics and metagenomics studies? Are there viruses that use yet unseen replication strategies? Can we make inferences extending across dsDNA viruses in the three domains of life? Here, we set out to address these questions by performing a global computational analysis of DNA replication proteins encoded by all sequenced bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic dsDNA viruses.; Genomes and proteomes of double-stranded DNA viruses were obtained from NCBI: ‘http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239&sort=taxonomy’. All the genomes of dsDNA viruses were subjected to six-frame translation and all previously unassigned open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 60 residues were retained for further analysis.; Replication proteins of dsDNA viruses were identified based on their similarity to characterized DNA replication proteins.;  To reduce the bias in database coverage of viral genomes, dsDNA viruses with highly similar genomes were filtered out, retaining a single representative member per virus group (see Materials and Methods).;  The length of the bar is proportional to the number of protein family members found in the representative set of dsDNA viruses.;  Replicative helicases in dsDNA viruses show a significantly higher diversity.; Diversity of replicative helicases domain organizations in dsDNA viruses.; Although SF1 helicases are abundant in viruses of the proposed order Megavirales (35), our data show that dsDNA viruses rarely (in 7% of the cases) use helicases of this type for genome replication (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  In dsDNA viruses we detected both types of primases and they were frequently fused with a replicative helicase or encoded next to it, as detailed above.;  We found that in dsDNA viruses SSBs based on the OB-fold are also most common, and the majority of them can be unambiguously linked to one of the groups represented by crystal structures of E. coli SSB (44), phage T7 protein gp2.5 (45), phage T4 protein gp32 (46), herpesvirus ICP8 (47) or archaeo-eukaryotic Replication Protein A (RPA) (48).;  Most often dsDNA viruses have E. coli SSB homologs that appear to be confined to bacteriophages (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  Since we did not find close Dna2 homologs in dsDNA viruses, we did not assign viral proteins of PD-(D/E)XK family to the list of putative primer removal proteins.;  We found that DNA ligases in dsDNA viruses are infrequent and that they are usually encoded in large genomes.;  Remarkably, Pandoraviruses, despite having the largest genomes among presently known dsDNA viruses, lack their own DNA ligase.;  DNA topoisomerases turned out to be among the least common DNA replication proteins in dsDNA viruses (Figure ​(Figure3).3).; Replication proteins arranged by their overall observed frequencies (%) in genomes of dsDNA viruses.; Replication protein complements identified across all groups of dsDNA viruses, provide a comprehensive picture of the distribution and frequency of different groups of replication proteins in the available viral genomes.;  We divided dsDNA viruses into three genome size groups (<40 kbp, 40–140 kbp and >140 kbp) in line with our previous finding (19) that the composition of DNA replicases is genome size-dependent.;  It turned out that as the genome size increases dsDNA viruses tend to code their own replication proteins more often (Figure ​(Figure5).5).;  These considerations are supported by our previous discovery of distant homologs of T7 SSB in nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (49) and examples of unique SSBs in poxviruses, phages and archaeal viruses (see above).; Relationship between the observed frequencies of viral DNA replication proteins and the genome size of dsDNA viruses.;  These observations suggest that the actions of DNA ligases and topoisomerases in dsDNA viruses might be closely coordinated.;  We found that B-family DNA polymerases and AEP primases, which are specific to replication machineries of archaea and eukaryotes, are conserved in dsDNA viruses from all three domains of life.;  If we consider the latter proteins at the family level, it appears that dsDNA viruses are just a reflection of their hosts, i.e., PCNA and RFC are identified in archaeal and eukaryotic viruses, whereas PolIIIβ and subunits of γ/τ-complex are only observed in bacteriophages.;  It has been demonstrated that bacterial members of the Caudovirales are evolutionarily related to tailed dsDNA viruses infecting archaea (31) and to eukaryotic members of the order Herpesvirales (73).; These and other patterns identified in our study reveal the fundamental logic of viral DNA replication that seems to be applicable to dsDNA viruses infecting hosts in all domains of life.\n",

coli for structure and functional studies.; \\nDeinococcus radiodurans R1 is a Gram-positive, extremophile, red-pigmented, nonmotile bacterium that is well-known for its extreme resistance to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide (40, 56).;  From top to bottom, the BCATs were from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrBCAT), human cytosolic (hBCATc), human mitochondrial (hBCATm), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsBCAT), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtBCAT), Escherichia coli (eBCAT), and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (HB8BCAT).\n",

extremophile—Deinococcus radiodurans R1 with a crucial core HD domain consisting of eight 11-mer motifs.; The protein DosH from Deinococcus radiodurans R1 contains 298 amino acids and is divided into three regions: the DS domain (position from 1 to 103), hydrophilic domain (HD) (position from 104 to 263) and C–terminal (position from 264 to 298).\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Transformants expressing artificial proteins had significantly higher stress resistance to oxidation, desiccation, salinity and freezing compared with the control group; E. coli with Motif1 and Motif8 had more outstanding performance in particular.; There is a key region in DosH, named HD (Hydrophilic Domain) [10,11]. HD contained the same proportion of helical structure after structural transitions compared with other HDs of G3LEA, but E. coli, expressing the HD protein (8 motifs), had a higher survival rate than those expressing the CeHD (from Caenorhabditis elegans, 24 motifs) and YlHD (Yarrowia lipolytica, 27 motifs) under both desiccation and oxidation conditions.;  In this study, we synthesized eight proteins that were naturally ordered, possessed chaperone-like features and are potentially involved in E. coli stress tolerance.;  Henceforth, to confirm the above conjecture, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET28a (+) plasmid encoding genes of nine proteins (molecular weight was 21.2, 38.9, 36.3, 38.9, 35.7, 39.2, 35.7, 39.3 and 36.8 kD, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S1) and induced to a final concentration of 0.3 mM at 16 °C using IPTG.; The nine E. coli transformants of overexpressed genes (HD, Motif1, Motif2, Motif3, Motif4, Motif5, Motif6, Motif7 and Motif8) under different abiotic stresses containing H2O2 (10 mM for 15 min), desiccation (for 20 days), NaCl (0.8 M for 48 h) and freeze–thawing (20 min, 3 times), were placed onto LB agar medium.;  In summary, for artificial proteins, Motif1 and Motif8 contributed most to E. coli tolerance.; Survival phenotypic analysis of E. coli recombinant strains under different conditions.; There is an antioxidant defense system equipped with enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in E. coli cells.; Aerobic organisms require oxygen molecules for ATP synthesis via oxidative respiration [30]. However, aerobic respiration generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products, mainly containing superoxide (O2−) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), occurring in many microbes, including E. coli [31]. These molecules have been known to cause functional and structural damage to cell components, which can lead to cell lysis and eventually cell death.;  All the above results suggested that non-natural proteins might offer protection when E. coli was in an oxidative condition.;  Several model peptides comprising two or four repeats of one of those motifs were synthesized to form a stable glassy matrix upon dehydration, which acted as a thermal stabilizer of biological glasses [17]. The model peptides derived from G3LEA, the degree of protection of which was comparable to that conferred by wild-type proteins, as reported previously for LDH [41], had the ability to preserve liposomes in the dry state simultaneously [43]. In vivo, E. coli cells expressing G3LEA peptides showed a better survival rate under stress conditions [40]. Combining the present results with a previous study, it was evident that the synthetic G3LEA model peptides had the ability not only to be stable enough to be maintained under stressful inhabitation conditions but also to preserve the catalytic activity of enzymes in a chaperone-like manner in the stress state by preventing the protein’s aggregation [10]. Based on these previous findings and the present results, we hypothesize that short peptides composed of motifs can work as a cytoskeleton in dried cells to enable anhydrobiotic organisms to survive desiccation environments or act as molecular shield to increase the survivability under abiotic stress, playing a similar role to full-length G3LEA proteins.;  Nonetheless, proteins Motif1 and Motif8 had a higher degree of α-helix structure and conferred E. coli the strongest viability under stresses environments (Figure 3).;  E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host strain to express proteins.; E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the corresponding plasmids were cultured in 50 mL flasks containing 20 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 10 g/L NaCl) with appropriate antibiotics for 12 h at 37 °C and 220 rpm.; E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the corresponding plasmids were cultured in 500 mL flasks containing 200 mL of LB medium with appropriate antibiotics for 2 h at 37 °C and induced using 0.3 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 12 h.; E. coli recombinant strains (BL21–pET, BL21–HD, BL21–Motif1, BL21–Motif2, BL21–Motif3, BL21–Motif4, BL21–Motif5, BL21–Motif6, BL21–Motif7, BL21–Motif8) were cultured in LB with appropriate antibiotics to OD600 ≈ 0.6 at 37 °C and were induced with IPTG at a final optimal concentration of 0.1 mM for 2 h.;  These proteins enhanced E. coli tolerance to different stresses and could protect enzyme activity in vitro.;  In addition, the recombinant E. coli containing artificial proteins had higher activities of total antioxidant capacity and less MDA production in vivo than that of the control group after oxidation treatment.\n",

                          Both laccases were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and characterized fully in parallel for strict benchmarking.;  HR03\\n[23], and Bacillus licheniformis\\n[24] have been expressed heterologously in E. coli, and those of Bacillus sp.; This paper reports the cloning, expression in an E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and characterization of a previously uncharacterized cotA from the gram-positive Bacillus clausii KSM-K16.;  Showing optimal growth near pH 9 [38], this species is known to produce alkali-, heat-, and detergent-resistant proteases such as the laundry M-protease with optimal enzymatic activity at pH 12.3 [39]. Since expression and handling protocols affect protein activation and consequently observed activities, as shown in this paper, to enable a strict benchmark for characterization, we simultaneously characterized the cotA from Bacillus subtilis 168 after expressing it in the same E. coli strain.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Recombinant E. coli cells were subjected to heat, cold, acidic, alkaline, and hyperosmolar stress to evaluate the effects of HSP20 proteins on stress resistance.;  Notably, the overexpression of 15 HSP20s enhanced the stress resistance of E. coli compared to that of the control strain.;  In particular, HSPs from Tepidimonas sediminis and Oceanithermus profundus improved the stress tolerance of E. coli under all tested conditions.;  In addition, E. coli harboring HSP20 from T. sediminis retained cell viability even after heat treatment at 52 °C for 5 days.;  To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. coli tolerance to prolonged (> 100 h) high-temperature stress.;  These findings indicate the potential of thermotolerant HSPs as molecular tools for improving stress tolerance in E. coli.;  In addition, HSP20s encoded by a genomic island improved the cell viability of E. coli at 60 °C (Li and Gänzle 2016).;  Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of HSP20 derived from multiple organisms can enhance cellular tolerance to diverse stresses in E. coli cells (Table 1).; Ezemaduka et al. (2014) demonstrated that the heterologous expression of small HSPs derived from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans allowed E. coli to grow at 50 °C, which is 3 °C higher than its maximum growth temperature.;  In this study, we aimed to introduce 18 small HSP20s from 12 thermophilic and thermotolerant bacteria into E. coli (Table 2) and evaluate their effects on various physical and chemical cellular stresses.;  E. coli strain One Shot TOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for gene cloning, and Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or BW25113 was used for the expression of genes encoding each HSP20.;  E. coli strains or their transformants were cultivated in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C at 180 rpm.;  The constructed plasmids were introduced into E. coli TOP10 cells through a brief heat shock (42 °C, 45 s), and the transformants were cultivated for 14–18 h at 37 °C with appropriate antibiotics (50 µg mL–1 of kanamycin for pET28a-based plasmids; 100 µg mL–1 of ampicillin for pBAD30-based plasmids).;  The pET28a-based plasmids were introduced into E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS competent cells.; The viability of E. coli cells was evaluated under extreme conditions (heat, cold, acidic, alkaline, and osmophilic).;  The transformants of E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS were cultivated to the logarithmic stage (OD600 = ca. 0.7) at 37 °C in LB medium with 50 µg mL–1 kanamycin and 17 µg mL–1 chloramphenicol.;  As a negative control, E. coli cells transformed with empty pET28a (+) vector (Novagen) or pET28a-ivy coding Ivy family C-type lysozyme inhibitor in E. coli (158 aa), a protein with similar molecular weight of HSP20, were used.;  As a positive control, E. coli cells harboring pET28a with genes coding small HSPs from E. coli (ibpA or ibpB), containing functional domains similar to those of the HSP20s from thermotolerant bacteria, or small HSP from C. elegans (CE) were used (Table 2).; Viability of the recombinant E. coli expressing thermophilic HSP20 was tested after long-term heat treatment.;  Two hsp20 genes (O2 and TS in Table 2) that enhance the thermotolerance of E. coli were evaluated.;  Each plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BW25113.; Eighteen HSP20s derived from 12 genera of thermotolerant bacteria were tested to evaluate their effects on the viability of E. coli under harsh conditions (Table 2 and Online Resource 2).;  We selected the bacterial genes from thermophiles and mesophiles belonging to the diverse taxonomic groups as follows: phylum Pseudomonadota (taxonomic group same as E. coli) [Tepidimonas (TS) and Pseudidiomarina (PH)], phylum Thermotogota (group containing mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles) [Thermotoga (TM) and Kosmotoga (KO)], phylum Aquificota containing chemoautotrophic thermophiles [Thermovibrio (TA), Desulfurobacterium (DT), and Hydrogenobacter (HT)], phylum Deinococcota [Oceanithermus (O1-3), halophilic thermophiles], phylum Rhodothermota [Rhodothermus (R1-3), halophilic thermophiles], phylum Cyanobacteriota [Thermosynechococcus (TE), photosynthetic thermophiles], and phylum Bacillota [Geobacillus (G1–3), spore-forming thermophiles]. Note that Pseudidiomarina (PH) is an exceptionally mesophilic genus.;  This result is consistent with those of previous studies where various small HSPs from eukaryotes and prokaryotes were successfully expressed in E. coli (Table 1).;  Most HSP20s from thermotolerant bacteria used in this study improved the resistance of E. coli to high and low temperatures as well as host’s small HSPs (EA and EB) (Fig. 2).;  In particular, the expression of O2, TE, or TS increased the cell viability equal to or greater than that of EA, EB, and CE from mesophilic organisms, which allowed the growth of E. coli at temperatures higher than its maximum growth temperature (Ezemaduka et al. 2014).;  The abbreviation of HSP20 is corresponding to that in Table 2. “NC” and “ivy” represent specific strains of E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS carrying different plasmids (pET28a and pET28a-ivy, respectively).;  Compared to the control strains harboring pET28a (NC) or pET28a-ivy (ivy), HSP20 also improved the viability of E. coli to multiple stresses other than extreme temperatures.;  For seven HSP20s (R1, O1, O2, TK, TE, TS, and PH), cell viability under acidic conditions significantly increased than that of the control strain with pET28a-ivy and were more than 100-fold higher compared to that of the control strains harboring empty vector (NC), suggesting that most HSP20s including small HSPs from E. coli enhanced the acid tolerance of E. coli (Fig. 3a).;  In addition, some HSP20s, including O2 and TS, enhanced the viability of E. coli after exposure to high osmotic pressure (10% [w/v] NaCl) (Fig. 3c).;  Two types of HSP20s, O2 and TS, successfully improved tolerance to a variety of stresses in E. coli.; Viability of each mutant under multiple stress conditions: a viability of each mutant exposed to acidic condition (pH 3 for 1 h); b viability of each mutant exposed to alkaline condition (pH 11 for 1 h); c viability of each mutant exposed to high osmotic condition [10%(w/v) of NaCl for 6 h]. The abbreviation of each HSP20 is corresponding to that in Table 2. “NC” and “ivy” represent specific strains of E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS carrying different plasmids (pET28a and pET28a-ivy, respectively).; We verified whether the maximum growth temperature of E. coli could be increased by HSP20s by O2 or TS expression.;  Although two sets of expression systems, pET28a/Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS and pBAD30/BW25113, were tested, HSP20 expression did not affect the maximum growth temperature (47 °C) of E. coli (Online Resource 6).;  Therefore, HSP20 from Tepidimonas affords E. coli to survive after prolonged (> 100 h) high-temperature stress.; We further investigated how HSP20 (TS) contributes to the homeostasis of E. coli under severe conditions.;  Compared with the other thermophiles used in this study, TS (beta-proteobacteria) is phylogenetically similar to E. coli (gammaproteobacteria).;  Therefore, the effective protection of E. coli cellular proteins by HSP20 (TS) may be due to their phylogenetic proximity and compatibility with structurally similar proteins.; In conclusion, we demonstrated the improvement in E. coli stress tolerance by the heterologous expression of HSP20s from thermotolerant microorganisms.;  Expression of several HSP20s enhanced stress tolerance in E. coli as much as or more than those of ibpA and ibpB from E. coli.;  In particular, E. coli with thermotolerant HSPs, such as O2 and TS, exhibited remarkable stress tolerance, comparable to that of C. elegans HSP20.;  These findings indicate the potential of thermotolerant HSPs as molecular tools for improving stress tolerance in E. coli.\n",

structure and functional studies.;  DrBCAT shows the highest specific activity both in nature and under ionizing radiation, but with lower thermal stability above 60°C, than either BCAT from Escherichia coli (eBCAT) or from Thermus thermophilus (HB8BCAT).;  D. radiodurans has been described as the organism most resistant to radiation: exponentially growing cells were 200 times as resistant to ionizing radiation and 20 times as resistant to UV irradiation as Escherichia coli (56).;  From top to bottom, the BCATs were from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrBCAT), human cytosolic (hBCATc), human mitochondrial (hBCATm), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsBCAT), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtBCAT), Escherichia coli (eBCAT), and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (HB8BCAT).\n",

express 18 HSP20s from 12 thermotolerant bacteria in Escherichia coli and evaluate their effects on various physical and chemical cellular stresses.;  For instance, endogenous small HSP20s from Escherichia coli (ibpA and ibpB) contribute to heat and hydrogen peroxide resistance (Kitagawa et al. 2000).; Previous studies for small HSPs on stress resistance of Escherichia coli; Sodium dodecyl

adapt to various harsh climates and soil conditions; thus, it is considered a desirable model plant for deciphering mechanisms of salt and other abiotic stresses.;  The crucifer Eutrema salsugineum (salt cress) formerly classified as Thellungiella salsuginea or Thellungiella halophila is a close relative of Arabidopsis.;  Eutrema salsugineum can naturally grow well in extreme environments and displays exceptionally high resistance to salt as well as cold, drought, and oxidative stresses, but its genetic make-up, morphology, and development are similar to the glycophyte Arabidopsis (Bressan et al., 2001; Inan et al., 2004; Taji et al., 2004; Volkov et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Gong et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2006; Amtmann, 2009; Orsini et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012; Koch and German, 2013; Figure 1).; Growth comparison of Eutrema salsugineum (Shandong) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants in the control (CK) and stress treatment conditions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Comparative genomics of the order Thermotogales revealed that the feather‐degrading F. islandicum AW‐1 has a complete Suf‐like machinery (SufCBDSU) that is highly expressed in cells grown on native feathers in the absence of elemental sulfur (S0).;  On the other hand, F. islandicum AW‐1 exhibited a significant retardation in the Suf system‐mediated keratin degradation in the presence of S0.;  To gain mechanistic insight into feather degradation associated with Fe–S cluster biogenesis, the Suf system of F. islandicum AW‐1 was phylogenetically and physicochemically characterized in detail.;  Indeed, together with growth profiles of F. islandicum AW‐1 in the presence and absence of S0, differential expression profiles of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism indicated that poor S0 availability might necessitate the use of the Suf system responsible for extracellular reducing environments as well as intracellular redox homeostasis via a cysteine‐cystine recycling.;  Among these members consisting of two families Fervidobacteriaceae and Thermotogaceae, F. islandicum AW‐1 together with few strains such as F. pennivorans DSM 9078 and F. thailandense FC 2004 is distinct in terms of keratin degradation, presumably due to the presence of its protease‐rich genome (Lee et al., 2015).;  However, closely related strains of F. islandicum AW‐1 such as F. islandicum H21 and F. gondwanense DSM 13020 have been reported to be lacking feather decomposition capability (Nam et al., 2002).;  To explore this further, we compared the whole‐genome sequence of F. islandicum AW‐1 with those of its phylogenetically closest relatives in Thermotogales to identify unique genetic features responsible for keratin degradation.;  This distinct feature suggests that the keratinolytic capability of F. islandicum AW‐1 may be ascribed to the presence of a complete Suf system for Fe–S cluster biogenesis.; The genome of F. islandicum AW‐1 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NZ_CP014334\",\"term_id\":\"2240388184\"}}NZ_CP014334) contains the 1266 bp gene NA23_RS08335 and 408 bp gene NA23_RS08330, annotated as SufS family cysteine desulfurase and Suf system NifU family Fe–S cluster assembly protein, respectively.;  Therefore, we tentatively concluded that these gene products might be F. islandicum AW‐1 enzymes SufS (FiSufS) and SufU (FiSufU), respectively.; The SufS–SufU complex of F. islandicum AW‐1.; Unlike other extracellular keratinases from Bacillus strains (Lin et al., 1995), F. islandicum AW‐1 has several membrane‐bound and cytosolic proteases for keratinolysis (Kang et al., 2020).;  Differential expression of genes affecting Fe–S cluster biogenesis in F. islandicum AW‐1 following growth on glucose and feathers during the mid‐exponential growth phase by qRT‐PCR analysis.;  Growth curves of F. islandicum AW‐1 in mTF medium only and mTF medium supplemented with 0.8% feathers in the presence and absence of S0 during anaerobic cultivation at 70°C.;  Time‐course of relative residual feathers during anaerobic cultivation with F. islandicum AW‐1 grown in mTF medium supplemented with 0.8% feathers in the presence and absence of S0.;  Time‐course of feather degradation activity (per g cells) during anaerobic cultivation with F. islandicum AW‐1 grown in mTF medium supplemented with 0.8% feathers in the presence and absence of S0.;  Time‐course of feather degradation by F. islandicum AW‐1 in the presence and absence of S0.;  Differential expression of genes affecting Fe–S cluster biogenesis in F. islandicum AW‐1 following growth on 0.8% feathers in the presence and absence of S0 during the mid‐exponential growth phase by qRT‐PCR analysis.; To investigate whether expression of the Suf‐like system is activated for feather degradation, we performed qRT‐PCR with RNAs extracted from F. islandicum AW‐1 cells (Fig. 4 and Table S3).;  To validate the effect of the sulfur source on keratin degradation by F. islandicum AW‐1, we examined whether keratin digestion is accelerated or retarded when cells are grown in the mTF medium supplemented with feathers in the presence and absence of S0 (Fig. 4).;  However, feather degradation by F. islandicum AW‐1 was significantly delayed and their keratin degradation activity was also decreased in the presence of S0 (Fig. 4E–G), indicating that a limitation to cellular sulfur availability is a prerequisite for keratin decomposition. Furthermore, differential expression gene (DEG) analysis of sulfur utilization genes using qRT‐PCR supports the notion that the expression of the suf operon and sulfur‐related genes were significantly upregulated in the absence of S0 (Fig. 4H).; Although F. islandicum AW‐1 exhibited a strong keratinolytic activity under starvation conditions, it remains unclear what substances are mainly responsible for generating an extracellular reducing equivalents under starvation conditions, and how insoluble keratins enriched with cysteine disulfide bonds can be utilized as a sulfur source by cells.; Metabolite profiles of F. islandicum AW‐1 grown on different nutrients.;  Growth curves of F. islandicum AW‐1 in mTF medium with and without 0.8% feathers during anaerobic cultivation at 70°C.;  In the present study, we performed comparative genomics integrated with comprehensive biochemical and biophysical characterization using an extremely thermophilic F. islandicum AW‐1 as an excellent model system to investigate the association of the Suf‐like system with keratin degradation.;  Since F. islandicum AW‐1 expresses high levels of sufCBD genes on feathers in the absence of S0, we predicted a correlation between sulfur availability and keratin degradation (Figs. 1 and ​and4),4), and it is intriguing how SufS and SufU may be involved in the degradation process.;  Indeed, F. islandicum AW‐1 expresses significantly high levels of the suf genes on feathers in the absence of S0.;  Notably, our transcriptomic analysis indicates that expression patterns of F. islandicum AW‐1 genes related to cellular adhesion to feathers are quite similar to those of these infectious pathogens (J‐Y.; Proposed mechanism of the FiSufS–SufU complex mediating extracellular cysteine and cystine recycling in keratin degradation by F. islandicum AW‐1.;  This explanation is more supported by the growth profiles of F. islandicum AW‐1 in the presence and absence of S0.;  Hence, in the presence of a high concentration of cysteine, the FiSufS–SufU complex in F. islandicum AW‐1 may be activated not only to incorporate cysteines into Fe–S clusters, but also to release extra cysteines as an extracellular reducing agent for extracellular sulfitolysis.;  Metabolite profiles

ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) and a heterotrophic iron-oxidizer (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”).;  In the extremely acidic (pH 0–2) and warm (35–45 °C) streams and pools within the abandoned Richmond mine at Iron Mountain, California, iron-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum spp.) and archaea (“Ferroplasma acidarmanus”) are often the dominant members of the acid streamer communities [3], whereas in higher pH (2–3) mine waters (e.g. at the Drei Konen und Ehrt pyrite mine in Germany, the Cae Coch pyrite mine in Wales) other iron-oxidizing bacteria (Acidithiobacillus spp. and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) tend to dominate in sites rich in pyrite and other sulfide minerals [4]. The Frasassi cave complex in Italy provides an interesting contrast to pyrite-rich mines in that the main energy source for the acidophiles that form snotites is reduced sulfur rather than ferrous iron, and consequently the dominant prokaryotes are sulfur-oxidizers (Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, with smaller numbers of Sulfobacillus and a bacterium related to Acidimicrobium [5]. Most data on the microbial compositions of acid streamers and snotites are from a single or relatively limited number of analyses of such growths whose “age” (in terms of how long they have been established) is unknown.;  These were “Ferrovum myxofaciens” (strain P3G), Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans (strain Py-F1), and a novel actinobacterium (strain Py-F3).;  Three iron-oxidizing bacteria dominated the streamer communities, two of which (Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and “Ferrovum myxofaciens”) were obligate chemolithotrophs and the third (a novel genus/species with the proposed name “Acidithrix ferrooxidans”) a heterotrophic acidophile.\n",

addition to its essential role in redox chemistry and stress responses of Fe–S cluster proteins, the Suf system may play an important role in keratin degradation by Fervidobacterium islandicum AW‐1.; The extremophilic bacterium Fervidobacterium islandicum AW‐1, belonging to the order Thermotogales, can completely degrade insoluble feathers composed of β‐keratins at 70°C under anaerobic conditions (Nam et al., 2002).; The 16S rRNA gene‐based phylogenetic analysis of 20 representative bacterial strains of the order Thermotogales known to be related to Fervidobacterium islandicum AW‐1 demonstrated that they formed a monophyletic group in this order that thrives mainly in volcanic or geothermal environments (Huber and Hannig, 2006) (Fig. 1A).\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The biosorption capacity of G. sulphuraria freeze-dried algal biomass was tested at different pHs, contact times, and biosorbent dosages.;  This study confirms the potential of freeze-dried cells of G. sulphuraria as innovative ecological biosorbents in technological applications for sustainable recycling of metals from e-waste and wastewater. ; G. sulphuraria is a polyextremophilic red alga thriving in highly acidic and thermal environments, such as volcanic environments, naturally rich in heavy, rare, and precious metals and capable of enacting unique metal tolerance mechanisms [17]. The interest in using G. sulphuraria living cells for bioremediation purposes [18,19] and in the bio-uptake (bioaccumulation) of metals grown very rapidly, thanks to the promising results and the increasingly comprehensive knowledge of their genomes [20,21]. Bioaccumulation is an active metabolic process which includes the interaction of metals with the cell surface (passive adsorption), followed by an active metabolism-dependent adsorption involving the transport of metal ions across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm, which is much slower than biosorption.;  A recent study on living cells of G. sulphuraria highlighted, particularly, that the adsorption of yttrium, cerium, europium, and terbium is pH-dependent [22].; In the present paper we tested the biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF 427 as a biosorbent for recovery of rare earth elements from a quaternary metal system of Y3+, Eu3+, Ce3+, and Tb3+. To evaluate the effective biosorption efficiency of G. sulphuraria spent algal biomass and to compare with uptake, performances of living cells, different pHs, different contact times, and different biosorbent dosages were tested.; In this study, the removal capacity of Y3+, Eu3+, Ce3+, and Tb3+ from quaternary metal systems was analyzed using freeze-dried algal biomass of G. sulphuraria, at constant and equimolar concentration of 178 µmol/L.; G. sulphuraria ACUF427, deposited at the ACUF algal collection of the University of Naples “Federico II” (http://www.biologiavegetale.unina.it/acuf.html, accessed on 22 January 2022), was used for this study.;  G. sulphuraria ACUF427 was cultivated mixotrophically in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks to obtain enough biomass for the experiments, in Allen medium [25], at pH 2.0, enriched with saccharose 2 g/L and grown at 37 °C under continuous fluorescent illumination (50 µmol photons/m2 s) with 16/8 h light/dark, and refreshed weekly.; In this study, the simultaneous removal capacity of Y3+, Eu3+, Ce3+, and Tb3+ from a quaternary metal system was studied using freeze-dried algal biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF427, at constant and equimolar concentration of 178 µmol/L (Ce3+, 25 mg/L; Eu3+, 27 mg/L; Y3+, 16 mg/L, and Tb3+, 28 mg/L).; The effects of biosorption parameters (pH, biosorbent dosage adsorption time) on the adsorption capacity of G. sulphuraria for yttrium, europium, cerium, and terbium are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 and the maximum adsorption capacity (µmol/g dry matter) data are shown in Table 1.; Total metals removed (µmol/g dw) from quaternary metal systems at pH 2.5 by freeze-dried algal biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF427 at different doses of biosorbent: (a) 2.5 mg/mL, (b) 5 mg/ mL, (c) 10 mg/mL, and (d) 20 mg/mL after 10, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min of contact time.; Total metals removed (µmol/g dw) from quaternary metal systems at pH 4.5 by freeze-dried algal biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF427 at different doses of biosorbent: (a) 2.5 mg/mL, (b) 5 mg/ mL, (c) 10 mg/mL, and (d) 20 mg/mL after 10, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min of contact time.; Maximum adsorption capacity (µmol/g dw) from quaternary metal systems at pH 2.5 and 4.5 by freeze-dried algal biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF427 at biosorbent dosage 2.5 mg/mL.;  Thus, in the quaternary system at pH 2.5 the element most adsorbed by G. sulphuraria ACUF427 was terbium, followed by cerium, europium, and yttrium (terbium > cerium > europium > yttrium).;  For yttrium recovery, only biomass (biosorbent dosage) influenced its biosorption (p < 0.05) by G. sulphuraria; in contrast, the p values of pH, biosorbent dosage, and time were all lower than 0.05 for cerium, europium, and terbium, indicating that these variables significantly influenced the biosorption.; Analysis of variance (two way-ANOVA), regression coefficient estimates and test of significance for adsorption capacity of freeze-dried G. sulphuraria for yttrium, cerium, europium, and terbium. *: level of significance; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.;  As shown by the plots, the maximum adsorption capacity of G. sulphuraria in the first 30 min increased more than twice as the pH increased from 2.5 to 4.5.; Few studies have been carried out on G. sulphuraria as a tool for biosorption of different types of metals in metal solutions.;  The biosorption of copper by G. sulphuraria was studied [26]; specifically, the interaction of copper and lead with G. sulphuraria in an aquatic medium was studied using stripping voltammetry.;  Freeze-dried biomass of G. sulphuraria was also used as a biosorbent in the recovery of Pt with an efficiency of more than 90% from a 2 M hydrochloric acid solution containing 10 mg/L Pt.;  In addition, Pt was adsorbed from a 2 M HCl solution along with 10 mg/L concentrations of seven metals, with a selectivity higher than that of ion exchange resins and activated carbon [27]. Freeze-dried cells of G. sulphuraria were shown to directly adsorb Au from simulated wastewater with a total acid concentration of 4 M, achieving an adsorption capacity of 35 ± 2.5 mg g−1 Au after 30 min exposure and a selectivity higher than that of an ion-exchange resin and comparable to that of activated carbon [28]. The use of G. sulphuraria for the biosorption of rare earth elements has already been investigated [10]. Nd(III), Dy(III), and Cu(II) were recovered (with more than 90% efficiency, at a concentration of 0.5 ppm) from a solution containing a mixture of different metals, i.e.; The suitability of the Cyanidiophyceae (G. maxima, G. sulphuraria, G. phlegrea, and Cyanidium caldarium) for potential biotechnological use in the effective and innovative recovery of precious metals was successfully evaluated [29]. Specifically, their tolerance of Cl4K2Pd and AuCl4K was tested by monitoring the growth and metabolic response of the four different taxa, which were exposed to each of these metals at a concentration in the range 1–10 g/L.; In this study, the removal of four rare metals from synthetic solution using freeze-dried biomass of G. sulphuraria as a biosorbent was investigated by assessing the effect of three parameters including pH (2.5 and 4.5), biosorbent dosage (2.5. 5, 10 and 20 mg/mL), and time (10, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min).;  Terbium was the element most easily adsorbed by the G. sulphuraria ACUF427.;  The results obtained agree with the literature, according to which the best performances of algal biomass of G. sulphuraria ACUF427 are registered at pH 4.5 [26]. ; Biomaterials such as freeze-dried cells of G. sulphuraria can be useful as ecological adsorbents, contributing to the sustainable recycling of rare and precious metals from electronic waste and wastewater rich in metal content, thus contributing to recovery from secondary sources and preventing the discharge of metal into the environment.;  The strength of using G. sulphuraria to recover rare earths is that REEs can be effectively biosorbed by Galdieria even if they are present in very low concentrations.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Comparative genomic analysis of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria sulphuraria predicts that the latter may be more broadly distributed in extreme environments because its genome contains membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds that are absent from C. merolae.;  Analysis of an endolithic site in the Phlegrean Fields near Naples, Italy is consistent with this prediction showing this population to be comprised solely of the newly described lineage Galdieria-B and C. merolae to be limited to humid habitats.; We find a second Galdieria lineage (Galdieria-A) in endolithic and interlithic habitats in Tuscany but surprisingly Cyanidium was also present at these sites.;  Population genetic analyses of a partial calmodulin gene fragment suggest a recent establishment or recurrent gene flow between populations in Tuscany, whereas the highly structured Galdieria-B population in Naples likely originated from 2–3 founder events.;  The TEM images show Galdieria-A (A) and Galdieria-B (B) from the endolithic sites.; As eukaryotic extremophiles, Cyanidiales grow at high temperature (50° – 55°C) and in extremely acidic (pH 0.5 – 3.0) habitats around hot springs and/or acidic sulfur fumes [5-8]. Because of their simple morphology, only three genera (Cyanidium, Cyanidioschyzon, and Galdieria) and six species of Cyanidiales have historically been recognized [5,9-12]. However, we recently discovered a high biodiversity of Cyanidiales at sites in Pisciarelli in the Phlegrean Fields near Napoli, Italy that included three putative new genus/order-level lineages.;  The results of this study suggested the one of the new lineages, provisionally named Galdieria-B, was adapted to and dominated the endolithic habitat [6].; Among previously described Cyanidiales, members of the genus Galdieria are distributed among inter- and endolithic habitats in addition to diverse microhabitats including non-thermophilic sites [1,5,6,12-14]. This genus is heterotrophic and mixotrophic, can grow on more than 50 carbon sources, and tolerates a broad range of pH (0.5 – 6.0) and salinity (4 – 10%) [5,12]. The metabolic flexibility of Galdieria may explain why this genus can thrive in diverse environments in contrast to Cyanidioschyzon merolae which appears to be limited to humid habitats [6]. A recent comparative genomic analysis of these two species supports this view showing the presence of a large number of membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds in the Galdieria sulphuraria genome that are absent from C. merolae [15]. However there is no direct evidence from physiological studies in C. merolae to support these predictions based on genome analyses.;  The trees inferred from the latter two analyses share a very similar topology with the ML-all tree (Fig. ​(Fig.2),2), except for the monophyletic clade composed of Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria maxima that is positioned with the Galdieria-A + -B lineage in the ML-protein tree.;  The internal topology of the Cyanidiales indicates a division into four lineages [6]; 1) Galdieria spp. (Galdiera-A and -B lineages, excluding Galdieria maxima), 2) Cyanidium caldarium, 3) mesophilic Cyanidium sp., and 4) Cyanidioschyzon merolae and Galdieria maxima.;  As apparent in the tree G. maxima is clearly separated from the other Galdieria species (e.g., G. sulphuraria, G. daedala, and G. partita) and shows a close relationship to C. merolae.;  This result is congruent with our previous study [6] and suggests that a taxonomic revision is required for the genus Galdieria.;  All of these clones were positioned in the Galdieria-A and Cyanidium lineages.;  Members of the Galdieria-A lineage were found at Monte Rotondo-4 (MR4in) (13/17 clones), Monte Rotondo-5 (MR5en) (6/15 clones), Monte Rotondo-6 (MR6en) (15/18 clones), Sasso Pissano-1 (SP1in) (4/22 clones), and Sasso Pissano-3 (SP3en) (18/18 clones).;  All clones from the SP3 site were however restricted to the Galdieria-A type.;  We did not find any representatives of the Galdieria-B lineage from the Larderello populations.;  This is in contrast to Pisciarelli which included an endolithic habitat (i.e., PBen, 19/19 of Galdieria-B) [6]. It is noteworthy that members of Cyanidium were found in many Larderello populations (MR4in, 4/17; MR5en, 9/15; MR6en, 3/18; and SP1in, 18/22) but were absent from the PBen site [6].; The 18 rbcL sequences of Galdieria-A from the SP3en site were virtually identical except for 1–2 non-informative substitutions per insert among the ca. 700 bp that were sampled.;  Similar to the SP3en site, the Pisciarelli-B (PBen) clones also consisted of virtually identical rbcL sequences of Galdieria-B [6]. To address the population structure at these sites, we chose to sample a more rapidly evolving nuclear sequence.;  In addition, a homologous region of the CaM gene from Galdieria sulphuraria DBV-009 and UTEX 2393 strains was also determined as reference.; The partial CaM coding region (nucleotides 58 – 283rd position in C. merolae) showed size variation (338 – 342 nt in length) in the SP-3 population (Galdieria-A).;  There was no size variation (385 nt) in the CaM gene from the PBen site (Galdieria-B).; The ME tree using the CaM sequences shows a highly diverse branching pattern for the SP3en population which is comprised of a single species (Galdieria-A).;  In the ME analysis of the PBen population (Galdieria-B) that is shown in Figure ​Figure3C3C there is a clear separation of the sequences into two (possibly three) lineages.; The Cyanidiales provide an untapped resource for understanding adaptations at the genomic level to life in extreme environments with one complete genome sequence already available (Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D) [15,17] and another that is nearly finished (Galdieria sulphuraria 074G) [18]. The Cyanidiales are unique in their ability as eukaryotes to thrive under extreme conditions at hot springs (temperatures between 50° – 55°C, pH between 0.5 – 3.0) [5-8,19]. These single-celled, photosynthetic red algae also have the ability to grow under low light conditions in endolithic habitats (see Fig. ​Fig.1)1) [1,4,6]. It is rare for eukaryotes to live beneath the rock surface, although endolithic prokaryotic communities have often been found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts, hot spring, and arctic regions) [3,4]. Endolithic Cyanidiales were first reported from Pisciarelli and La Solfatara near Naples, Italy [1]. These authors assumed, based on gross morphology (i.e., cell size from SEM images, see Fig. ​Fig.33 in Gross et al. [1]) that the endolithic Cyandiales were species of Cyanidium and Galdieria.;  However, traditional taxonomic characters are not very useful in identifying morphologically simple, coccoid Cyanidiales cells [5,6]. We recently surveyed environmental samples from Pisciarelli and found a new lineage termed Galderia-B that dominates the endolithic habitat [6]. It was postulated that Galdieria-B had adapted to this relatively dry environment.;  Here we tested whether Galdieria-B also dominates the endolithic habitat at another site (Larderello, Tuscany, Italy) and contrasted the population structure in Pisciarelli and Larderello.;  Four sites (except SP3en) were composed of two species, Galdieria-A and Cyanidium caldarium.;  The SP3en site consisted of a single species (Galdieria-A).;  Individuals of Galdieria-A were more abundant in the endolithic populations (100% SP3en, 83% MR6en), however this species was also abundant at an interlithic site (76% at MR4in).;  It is surprising, despite our low sample size, that we did not identify other Cyanidiales species (i.e., Cyanidioschyzon merolae, Galdieria-B, and G. maxima) at the Larderello sites.;  Galdieria-B was of particular interest because it was rich in endolithic (100% PBen) and interlithic (40% P-C) sites at Pisciarelli [6]. These data suggest that several genetically divergent Cyanidiales taxa have likely adapted to flourish in the endolithic environment.;  Galdieria has however been reported to be heterotrophic and mixotrophic and able to grow on more than 50 carbon sources [5,12,20]. Galdieria takes up a broad range of sugars and sugar alcohols using a variety of membrane transporters [20] that have been identified in the G. sulphuraria genome [15]. Gross et al. [1] demonstrated heterotrophic growth of G. sulphuraria using as nutrients an acid extract of autotrophically grown Galdieria cells.;  Therefore, it is possible that Galdieria grows photoautotrophically at the top of the biomat directly beneath the rock surface, whereas these cells grow heterotrophically in deeper regions of the algal layer, surviving on organic materials provided by dead cells [1].;  It is still unknown whether C. caldarium encodes the membrane transporters identified in the Galdieria genome, although this species has characters such as a cell wall, a central vacuole, and the osmolyte floridoside (as in Galdieria) [12,15] that are critical for heterotrophic growth.;  We included these sequences in phylogenetic trees (results not shown) and identified them as originating from G. suphularia (Galdieria-A; {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911434\",\"term_id\":\"62736087\",\"term_text\":\"AY911434\"}}AY911434, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911459\",\"term_id\":\"62736112\",\"term_text\":\"AY911459\"}}AY911459), G. maxima ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911496\",\"term_id\":\"62736149\",\"term_text\":\"AY911496\"}}AY911496), and C. merolae ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY911454\",\"term_id\":\"62736107\",\"term_text\":\"AY911454\"}}AY911454).; Because the CaM intron regions from Galdieria at the Larderello (Galdieria-A; SP3en, MR4in, MR5en, MR6en) and Pisciarelli (Galdieria-B; PBen) endolithic sites could not be reliably aligned these data sets were analyzed separately.;  The tree of the Larderello sequences shown in Figure ​Figure3B3B shows a paraphyletic radiation of Galdieria-A into the four sites.;  In contrast, the CaM sequences from the endolithic Pisciarelli PBen site formed 2 distinct clades suggesting that two (or potentially three) independent inoculations of Galdieria-B occurred here.;  Gross et al. [1] provided preliminary support for this colonization method based on their finding that after the application of an artificial silica layer on Galdieria cells, these algae maintain a dark-green color for 4 weeks, even when the silica layer becomes 1 mm thick [1]. In contrast, the PBen population was likely colonized by inoculation of 2 – 3 founder cells.;  Four novel degenerate primers were designed to amplify the CaM gene based on available data from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project [22] and the Galdieria sulphuraria Genome Project [23] (with the aid of A.;  We also included the CaM sequences from the Galdieria sulphuraria DBV-009 and UTEX 2393 strains as the positive control in these analyses.\n",

broadly distributed in extreme environments because its genome contains membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds that are absent from C. merolae.; Among previously described Cyanidiales, members of the genus Galdieria are distributed among inter- and endolithic habitats in addition to diverse microhabitats including non-thermophilic sites [1,5,6,12-14]. This genus is heterotrophic and mixotrophic, can grow on more than 50 carbon sources, and tolerates a broad range of pH (0.5 – 6.0) and salinity (4 – 10%) [5,12]. The metabolic flexibility of Galdieria may explain why this genus can thrive in diverse environments in contrast to Cyanidioschyzon merolae which appears to be limited to humid habitats [6]. A recent comparative genomic analysis of these two species supports this view showing the presence of a large number of membrane transporters involved in the uptake of reduced carbon compounds in the Galdieria sulphuraria genome that are absent from C. merolae [15]. However there is no direct evidence from physiological studies in C. merolae to support these predictions based on genome analyses.;  In addition, a homologous region of the CaM gene from Galdieria sulphuraria DBV-009 and UTEX 2393 strains was also determined as reference.; The Cyanidiales provide an untapped resource for understanding adaptations at the genomic level to life in extreme environments with one complete genome sequence already available (Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D) [15,17] and another that is nearly finished (Galdieria sulphuraria 074G) [18]. The Cyanidiales are unique in their ability as eukaryotes to thrive under extreme conditions at hot springs (temperatures between 50° – 55°C, pH between 0.5 – 3.0) [5-8,19]. These single-celled, photosynthetic red algae also have the ability to grow under low light conditions in endolithic habitats (see Fig. ​Fig.1)1) [1,4,6]. It is rare for eukaryotes to live beneath the rock surface, although endolithic prokaryotic communities have often been found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts, hot spring, and arctic regions) [3,4]. Endolithic Cyanidiales were first reported from Pisciarelli and La Solfatara near Naples, Italy [1]. These authors assumed, based on gross morphology (i.e., cell size from SEM images, see Fig. ​Fig.33 in Gross et al. [1]) that the endolithic Cyandiales were species of Cyanidium and Galdieria.;  Four novel degenerate primers were designed to amplify the CaM gene based on available data from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project [22] and the Galdieria sulphuraria Genome Project [23] (with the aid of A.;  We also included the CaM sequences from the Galdieria sulphuraria DBV-009 and UTEX 2393 strains as the positive control in these analyses.\n",

as a model for biotechnology and astrobiology to investigate potential life beyond Earth.;  To understand the mechanisms that allow proteins to adapt to both salinity and cold, we structurally (including X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations) and functionally characterized the β-galactosidase from H. lacusprofundi (hla_bga).; Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of the β-galactosidase enzyme from H. lacusprofundi (hla_bga), which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 42 and exhibits psychrophilic and halophilic properties. β-galactosidases (E.C. 3.2.1.23) catalyze the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, as well as the transgalactosylation of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides.; The β-galactosidase (bga) gene from H. lacusprofundi was PCR amplified from the genome and cloned via NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit into pTA963, to generate the pTA963_bga expression plasmid

                                                   Under conditions of limited iron, the extremophile Halobacterium salinarum, a salt-loving archaeon, mounts a specific response to scavenge iron for growth.;  Two members of a novel TRASH metal-binding domain protein family have been implicated in regulating the copper response, one in Halobacterium salinarum and the other in Sulfolobus solfataricus (21,22).;  Halobacterium salinarum possesses an inducible response system to changes in iron levels in the medium (21,29).; Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 (ATCC700922) was routinely grown in complete medium (CM; 250 g/l NaCl, 20 g/l MgSO4 7H2O, 3 g/l sodium citrate, 2 g/l KCl, 10 g/l peptone) or complete defined medium (CDM, Supplementary Table S1) supplemented with 10 µM MnSO4,

NaCl and up to 20% (v/v) of organic solvents.;  Haloferax volcanii H1895 and its corresponding vector pTA96346 were kindly provided by Dr.;  Haloferax volcanii and derivatives were cultured in the Hv-YPC medium at 45 °C with shaking as previously described [15,35]. For solid media, 2% (w/v) agar was added, and when required, 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) was added to 40 μg/mL.;  Primers used for amplification and sequencing are listed in Table S1. β-galactosidase gene containing vector, pTA963_bga was transformed into the Haloferax volcanii H1895 using the polyethylene glycol/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(PEG/EDTA) method.;  We solved this problem by cloning the hla_bga gene as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein for expression in the Haloferax volcanii expression systems [15,35], a genetically tractable haloarchaeal strain lacking β-galactosidase activity (Table S1, Figures S1 and S2, see Methods).\n",

the protein band responsible of laccase activity was identified and the corresponding band was excised from Coomassie-stained gel. nLC–MS/MS analyses on the band, briefly summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S6, clearly show that Ant laccase matches with three proteins correlated to a potential laccase-like activity: a copper resistance protein CopA from H. meridiana (ID A0A0D7UVK4, sequence coverage 30.64%), and two copper resistance system multicopper oxidases from two Halomonas species, i.e., Halomonas piezotolerans (ID

activity of the Ant laccase preparation (SNP30) from Halomonas sp.; Effect of pH and temperature on the activity and stability of the Ant laccase preparation from Halomonas sp.; Effect of NaCl (A), DMSO (B) and Tween-80 (C) concentrations on Ant laccase activity in the crude enzyme preparation from Halomonas sp.;  Despite their potential, to our knowledge, no laccases have been identified and functionally characterized from these Halomonas spp. yet.; The Ant laccase that we identified in Halomonas sp.;  The Ant laccase from Halomonas sp.;  This phenomenon was also reported for two azoreductases isolated from Halomonas species, which were tolerant to NaCl but showed their highest activity in its absence (Eslami et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2019).; We can conclude that the various characteristics displayed by the Halomonas sp.\n",

the protein band responsible of laccase activity was identified and the corresponding band was excised from Coomassie-stained gel. nLC–MS/MS analyses on the band, briefly summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S6, clearly show that Ant laccase matches with three proteins correlated to a potential laccase-like activity: a copper resistance protein CopA from H. meridiana (ID A0A0D7UVK4, sequence coverage 30.64%), and two copper resistance system multicopper oxidases from two Halomonas species, i.e., Halomonas piezotolerans (ID

activity of the Ant laccase preparation (SNP30) from Halomonas sp.; Effect of pH and temperature on the activity and stability of the Ant laccase preparation from Halomonas sp.; Effect of NaCl (A), DMSO (B) and Tween-80 (C) concentrations on Ant laccase activity in the crude enzyme preparation from Halomonas sp.;  Despite their potential, to our knowledge, no laccases have been identified and functionally characterized from these Halomonas spp. yet.; The Ant laccase that we identified in Halomonas sp.;  The Ant laccase from Halomonas sp.;  This phenomenon was also reported for two azoreductases isolated from Halomonas species, which were tolerant to NaCl but showed their highest activity in its absence (Eslami et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2019).; We can conclude that the various characteristics displayed by the Halomonas sp.\n",

                           The haloarchaeon Halorubrum lacusprofundi is among the few polyextremophilic organisms capable of surviving in one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, the Deep Lake of Antarctica (−18 °C to +11.5 °C and 21–28%, w/v salt content).;  Halorubrum lacusprofundi, a completely sequenced extremely halophilic archaeon isolated from Deep Lake Antarctica is an attractive system for detailed structural and functional analysis of protein adaptation in extreme conditions and of special interest for astrobiology [28,30].

     Biodiversity of the acid streamers became somewhat greater in time, and included species of heterotrophic acidophiles that reduce ferric iron (Acidiphilium, Acidobacterium, Acidocella and gammaproteobacterium WJ2) and other autotrophic iron-oxidizers (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans).;  There was also a notable increase in the biodiversity of the streamer growths, with several additional species being either firmly (gammaproteobacterium WJ2, At. ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans) or tentatively (Acidiphilium and Alicyclobacillus spp.) identified compared to those detected during the first months of sampling, though some of these (in contrast to At. ferrivorans, “Fv. myxofaciens” and actinobacterium Py-F3) were only detected sporadically.;  One major difference found at both times was that the iron-oxidizing autotroph Leptospirillum ferrooxidans accounted for a far greater part of the summated bacterial T-RFs in the mine water (average of 12.5% and 1.4% in 2008 and 2012, respectively) than in the acid streamers (corresponding mean values of 0.7 and 0.6%, and frequently not detected).\n",

sources,\\nincluding pulverized smartphones, demonstrating the flexibility and\\npotential for use as a recovery platform for these critical metals.;  Bioaccumulation and biomineralization\\nof REEs in mesophilic bacteria were first shown in the model methylotroph Methylobacterium (also known as Methylorubrum) extorquens AM1.34 Methylotrophic\\nbacteria, organisms that thrive on inexpensive, readily available\\none-carbon compounds such as methane and methanol, therefore provide\\nan attractive new approach for REE bioleaching and extraction due\\nto their natural ability to acquire Lns from the surrounding environment.35,36 This includes soluble and insoluble REE sources, such as electronic\\nwaste (E-waste).37−39M. extorquens AM1\\nwas the first organism reported to grow using REE from electronic\\nwaste.36 Mesophilic methylotrophs like M. extorquens AM1 have dedicated systems for acquisition,\\nuptake, and intracellular storage of Lns as polyphosphate granules,\\nmaking them effective agents of bioleaching and bioaccumulation without\\nthe need for high acidity or temperature.34 REE use by mesophilic methylotrophs was thought to be restricted\\nto the light Ln, but recently, a genetic variant of M. extorquens AM1 was isolated and characterized\\nthat can transport, store, and grow using the heavy Ln, gadolinium.40 Detailed genetic and Ln uptake studies indicate\\nthe likely possibility of an additional system dedicated to the acquisition\\nand transport of heavy Lns.;  Thus, methylotrophs, such as M. extorquens AM1, may already possess the biological\\nmeans to separate light and heavy Lns, and have the potential to be\\nengineered for uptake of specific Ln species from complex feedstocks.\\nTo date, the potential of methylotrophs as a platform for REE recovery\\nhas not been rigorously investigated, including the selectivity of\\nthe REE uptake.;  We also show the potential for process improvement\\nby leveraging the genetic tractability and suite of genetic tools\\navailable for M. extorquens AM1 to\\nengineer enhanced, nonacidic REE bioleaching (∼20-fold) and\\nbioaccumulation (∼50-fold) attributes.;  This study provides\\na proof-of-principle demonstration of M. extorquens AM1 as a scalable platform for biomining and bioaccumulation of\\nREEs from complex feedstocks, such as magnet swarf, without the need\\nof harsh acids and high temperatures, greatly reducing potential hazards\\nand obstacles to generating a circular economy (Figure ​Figure11).; M. extorquens AM1 is a platform\\nfor Nd recovery through efficient, high-yield bioaccumulation from\\ncomplex sources.;  REEs in complex feedstocks are accessible to M. extorquens AM1 due to its innate ability to selectively\\nacquire, transport, and accumulate metals in polyphosphate granules.\\nMetal leaching and REE uptake can be enhanced by the addition of organic\\nacid to the culture medium and strain engineering, resulting in greater\\nNd recovery yields.; All growth\\nstudies were performed using the ΔmxaF strain\\nof M. extorquens AM1.;  Deletion of this gene ensures REE dependency\\nfor growth with methanol via primary oxidation catalyzed by alternative\\nREE-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases.41 For routine culturing of M. extorquens AM1, strains were grown in 16 × 125 mM borosilicate culture\\ntubes shaking at 200–220 rpm, 29–30 °C in modified Methylobacterium PIPES (MP) or Hypho minimal medium containing\\n2–20 μM calcium chloride,41,42 with 1.75\\ng/L succinate as a sole carbon source.;  A genetic system for overproducing\\nthe lanthanophore was constructed and transformed into M. extorquens AM1 with the purpose of increasing\\nnonacidic bioleaching of REEs.; M. extorquens growth\\nperformance with 1% (m/v) Nd magnet swarf was benchmarked in a 0.75\\nL benchtop bioreactor with 1.6 g/L methanol (Figure ​Figure22A).; M. extorquens growth with Nd magnet\\nswarf and methanol. (A) 0.75 L bioreactor growth in full inorganic\\nphosphate Hypho minimal medium (see Methods) and 1% (w/v) Nd magnet\\nswarf. (B) Microplate growth with full phosphate (blue), half phosphate\\n(HyphoMOD; orange), and quarter phosphate (gray) medium\\nand 1% (w/v) magnet swarf. (C) 50 mL shake flask culture growth with\\nHyphoMOD and 1% (w/v) magnet swarf. (D) 0.75 L bioreactor\\ngrowth with HyphoMOD medium and 1% (w/v) magnet swarf.\\n(E) 0.75 L bioreactor growth with HyphoMOD medium and 10%\\nmagnet swarf. (F) 0.75 L bioreactor growth with 1% (w/v) magnet swarf.\\n(G) 10 L bioreactor growth with HyphoMOD medium and 1%\\nmagnet swarf.; M. extorquens AM1 stores\\nREE as\\nintracellular polyphosphate granules.34 Baseline Nd bioaccumulation levels were measured from bioreactor\\ncultures grown in standard Hypho minimal medium (Table 1).;  Relative to the baseline\\nbioaccumulation level, M. extorquens AM1 grown in HyphoMOD accumulated 3.6-fold more Nd when\\ngrown with 1% pulp density (Table 1).;  Even at 10% pulp density, growth rate REE bioaccumulation by M. extorquens AM1 was still high (Figure ​Figure22E and Table 1) showing that the process is not inhibited\\nby a 10-fold increase in REE feedstock.; Next, we tested the\\nperformance of M. extorquens AM1 under\\nmethanol fed-batch conditions in a 0.75 L bioreactor.\\nBy repeated feeding of methanol over the run cycle, culture densities\\nof 20 OD were achieved without a significant reduction in growth rate\\n(Figure ​Figure22F).; To assess the selectivity of M. extorquens AM1 uptake for REE, we determined the metal content of the abiotic\\nleachate and cells and supernatants of cultures grown with 1% (w/v)\\nmagnet swarf.;  This\\nwas ∼1.6-fold higher than what was observed in the 1 mL microplate\\ncultures as mentioned above and could possibly be accounted for by\\nmore efficient mixing of swarf with M. extorquens AM1 in a stirred-tank system.;  M. extorquens AM1 was grown\\nin HyphoMOD methanol medium with a 1% Nd\\nmagnet swarf.;  M. extorquens AM1 was grown in 1 mL of HyphoMOD methanol medium with\\n1% Nd magnet swarf and 0, 5, or 15 mM citrate.;  The increase in leached Dy\\nwith the addition of citrate was twice that of Nd or Pr (Table S1), which may be attributable to its higher\\ncomplex formation constant with citrate (logK = 10.69\\nvs 9.76–9.94).63 Addition of 55\\nmM gluconate or 5 mM oxalate, the highest permissible concentration\\nof each for comparable growth of M. extorquens, did not increase REE leaching as compared to the negative control\\ncondition, though Fe concentrations did increase by 12- and 4.2-fold,\\nrespectively (Table S1).; We investigated whether nonspecific leaching\\nby the biolixiviant\\ncitrate would alter the specificity of REE uptake by M. extorquens AM1.;  M. extorquens AM1 ΔmxaF grew well with 1% (w/v) magnet\\nswarf as the sole source of REE, with a significantly higher growth\\nrate as compared to that grown with soluble La (Figures ​Figures55A and S4; ANOVA\\nwith Tukey HSD, pTukey = 5.4 × 10–9).; Growth of M. extorquens AM1 ΔmxaF in HyphoMOD medium with\\n1.6 g/L MeOH and\\n2 μM La, 1% (w/v) magnet swarf, or 1% (w/v) magnet swarf supplemented\\nwith citrate (5 or 15 mM), gluconate (55 mM), or oxalate (5 mM). (A)\\nGrowth rate of M. extorquens AM1 ΔmxaF, (B) metals leached into the spent medium, and (C)\\nmetals associated with biomass were determined based on biological\\ntriplicates.;  As expected from the abiotic leaching results (Figure S3), addition of citrate greatly improved REE leaching\\n(Figures ​Figures55B and S5A; pBonf ≤\\n0.001), and led to greater REE uptake by M. extorquens AM1 ΔmxaF (Figures ​Figures55C and S5B; pBonf ≤ 0.001).;  Interestingly, more REE\\nwas associated with biomass when 5 mM, rather than 15 mM, citrate\\nwas supplemented, suggesting that there exists a balance between abiotic\\nleaching and biological uptake at the scale tested (Figure S5B; pTukey ≤ 0.04).\\nIn fact, upon scale-up of the culture volume to 100 mL, 15 mM citrate\\ninhibited growth of M. extorquens AM1\\nΔmxaF (Figure S6).;  Overall, these\\ndata show highly selective, ∼3.6-fold bioconcentration of REE\\nfrom magnet swarf by M. extorquens AM1.\\nBased on these highly promising results, M. extorquens AM1 appears naturally poised as a competitive REE bioaccumulation\\nmicrobe with scalable growth.;  In 1 mL cultures, the same batch of magnet swarf was\\nable to sustain growth of M. extorquens AM1 ΔmxaF for five cycles, though the final\\nOD and total leached REE concentrations decreased with continuing\\ngrowth cycles (Figure S7).; The genetic tractability and availability of genetic tools for\\nstrain engineering make M. extorquens AM1 a uniquely suitable microbial platform for REE recovery.;  A biosynthetic\\npathway for an REE-chelator (lanthanophore) has been previously reported\\nand was named mll after its product methylolanthanin.64 Expression of the mll has already\\nbeen shown to increase Nd uptake in M. extorquens AM1 from both soluble chloride and poorly soluble oxide forms in\\na highly specific manner.64 We tested the\\nimpact of expressing the mll in trans during growth\\nwith magnet swarfs and saw increases in REE bioaccumulation.;  Notably,\\nexpression of the mll was under control of the lac promoter, a comparatively weak promoter in M. extorquens AM1.65 Generation\\nof a stronger expression system is underway and in theory should boost\\nREE bioaccumulation even further.; Strain engineering for increased REE bioaccumulation.\\n(A), in trans\\nexpression of the mll enhances REE (Nd, neodymium;\\nPr, praseodymium; Dy, dysprosium) bioaccumulation from magnet swarf\\nin M. extorquens AM1, with minimal\\nFe uptake. ΔmxaF, solid bars; ΔmxaF/pAZ1, hatched bars.; Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) has been shown to directly bind\\nREEs66 and has been implicated in microbial\\nREE solubilization.62 We recently reported M. extorquens AM1 strain evo-HLn40 that exhibited enhanced PQQ production in the presence\\nof the heavy REE, gadolinium.; REEs are stored in intracellular polyphosphate granules in M. extorquens AM1.; The results shown herein demonstrate\\nthat selective targeting of\\nspecific processes for REE metabolism, generated by a detailed understanding\\nof the physiology of M. extorquens AM1,\\nis an effective strategy for engineering enhanced REE storage.;  M. extorquens AM1, a bacterium with the natural ability\\nto solubilize and accumulate REE, provides a unique pathway toward\\nselective REE bioleaching, bioaccumulation, and recovery that is scalable\\nand does not rely on extremophile organisms and their inherent limitations.\\nFuture work will investigate this further with a focus on end-to-end\\nconversion of feedstock to scalable rare earth oxide products.;  The\\npotential of M. extorquens AM1 to recover\\nREE is not limited to E-waste, as our process is compatible with even\\nthe most unrefined sources, such as monazite and bastnäsite\\nores, and pulverized smartphones (Table S2).;  M. extorquens AM1 is uniquely suited\\nbiologically for REE recovery through its production of lanthanophores,\\ndedicated REE transport machinery, and its capability for producing\\nREE-phosphate granules that will facilitate purification.;  The potential\\nreduction in REE mining and refinement pollution and hazardous exposure\\nmake M. extorquens AM1 an attractive,\\ngreen alternative to current chemical methodologies.\n",

              By genomics, proteomics, and biochemical approaches, the extracellular heat-stable keratinase (MtaKer) from M. taiwanensis WR-220 was identified.; To examine its keratinolytic ability, M. taiwanensis WR-220 was cultured at 55 °C in medium with insoluble feathers as the only source of nutrients.; Degradation of intact chicken feathers by M. taiwanensis WR-220. (a) M. taiwanensis WR-220 degraded native chicken feathers at 55 °C after two days of incubation.;  The basal medium contained 0.5% feathers (w/v) as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. (b) The remaining feathers after decay in two days culture at 55 and 65 °C were shown on filter papers. (c) M. taiwanensis WR-220 displayed high feather-degrading activity at 55 and 65 °C compared to the Meiothermus species, M. ruber.; Our purification process to identify the extracellular keratinase in M. taiwanensis WR-220 is outlined in Fig. 2a.;  In this study, we have reported strong keratinolytic ability in the indigenous isolate M. taiwanensis WR-220 in culture even at 65 °C (Fig. 1), and further identified a single gene encoding the secreted keratinase MtaKer using chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S1).; In conclusion, we identified and purified a novel heat-stable keratinase MtaKer from M. taiwanensis WR-220.; The strains M. taiwanensis WR-220 (ATCC BAA-400) isolated from Wu-rai Hot Spring in northern Taiwan and M. ruber DSM 1279 T were grown under aerobic conditions at 55 °C in Thermus modified (TM) medium11, 39.;  The genes encoding MtaKer, AquI, and Deirad, were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of M. taiwanensis WR-220, T. aquaticus YT1, and D, radiodurans R1, respectively.\n",

   In this report, a feather-degrading thermophilic bacterium, Meiothermus taiwanensis WR-220, was investigated due to its ability to apparently complete feather decay at 65 °C in two days.; In this study, we identified a thermostable keratinase (MtaKer) from the thermophile strain, Meiothermus taiwanensis WR-220, which grows at 55–65 °C11.\n",

which contains a small fraction of tRNAArgACG with a non-deaminated wobble adenosine.;  Osawa and co-workers (22) experimentally proved in vitro that the naturally occurring A34-containing tRNAThrAGU from the bacterium Mycoplasma capricolum translates all four threonine ACN codons, and only the Thr-ACA codon showed greatly reduced efficiency.\n",

                                 \\nNatronomonas pharaonis is an archaeon adapted to two extreme conditions: high salt concentration and alkaline pH.;  Results of the analysis include the finding that Natronomonas pharaonis, when grown aerobically on acetate, uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production.;  Natronomonas pharaonis is one that has been able to adapt to both high salt concentration and an alkaline pH.;  Specifically, we reconstructed the network by collecting evidence for the existence of reactions from the literature, and then supplemented them with computational approaches, for example by searching the genome of Natronomonas pharaonis for genes that could potentially encode analogs of known enzymes from other organisms.;  Among other results, we found indications that Natronomonas pharaonis regulates its metabolism such that energy production and growth are maximized.;  Despite this however, we also found that Natronomonas pharaonis is only able to incorporate a very small fraction of the total carbon that it consumes (approximately 35%), likely in no small part due to the difficulties posed by its environment.; \\nNatronomonas pharaonis is a polyextremophilic archaeon that can be isolated from soda lakes, where it has to cope with two extreme conditions: high salt concentration and an alkaline pH.;  Two strains of Natronomonas pharaonis have been described so far: strain Gabara from lake Gabara in Egypt (DSM 2160) [1], which was used in this study, and strain SP1 from lake Magadi in Kenya (DSM 3395) [2]. Among other results, we show that the microorganism is able to grow on a single carbon source, such as acetate, glutamate and pyruvate, unlike the more well-studied halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum.;  The combination of this capability, a completely sequenced genome [3] and the recent successful development of a transformation protocol (separate publication) will increase the prominence of Natronomonas pharaonis in the study of extremophilic life.; Genome-scale models of metabolism have been constructed and analyzed for various organisms [6], yielding interesting results, such as the prediction of E. coli metabolic mutant phenotypes up to an accuracy of 86% [17], a simulation and characterization of E. coli's secreted metabolites under various nutrient and oxygenation conditions [14], a study of the methanogenic growth of M. barkeri\\n[18], and an analysis of growth on a relatively complex medium for L. plantarum\\n[19] and Halobacterium salinarum\\n[20], [21]. In this work, we present a manually curated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for Natronomonas pharaonis, and report on the development and use of a constraints-based model from it.; The reconstructed Natronomonas pharaonis metabolic network is composed of 683 reactions and 597 distinct metabolites.;  Given the relatively recent isolation of Natronomonas pharaonis, its literature base, particularly for subjects relevant to metabolism, is still quite small.; The reconstructed metabolic network for Natronomonas pharaonis is composed of 683 reactions, covering 654 genes, and 597 metabolites.; We obtained an initial draft of the metabolic network by merging the reaction database (LIGAND) from KEGG [22] with the Natronomonas pharaonis genome annotation found in Halolex [23], [24]. The latter resource is a genome information system that specializes in halophilic microorganisms.;  For example, it was recently shown that aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii does not use the classical precursors erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, but rather proceeds via an alternative pathway that begins with the condensation of 6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate with aspartate 4-semialdehyde [25]. Genetic evidence suggests that the same (or a similar) pathway is in operation in Natronomonas pharaonis.;  Again, genetic evidence suggests that this pathway is also in operation in Natronomonas pharaonis.;  This protein consists of two distinct subunits, which in Natronomonas pharaonis are encoded by NP4044A (beta subunit) and NP4046A (alpha subunit).;  Clearly, a prerequisite for the definition of this reaction for Natronomonas pharaonis is an approximation of the microorganism's average biomass composition, at least under the conditions used.;  Given that proteins typically account for a large fraction, if not a majority, of the organic mass of most microorganisms, we began our characterization of the Natronomonas pharaonis biomass by analyzing its amino acid content.;  For these amino acids, statistical analysis of the predicted Natronomonas pharaonis proteome was used to specify coefficients in the growth reaction (see Growth on Acetate).; 2-Sulfotrehalose has been demonstrated to be an osmolyte used by several haloalkaliphilic archaea, including Natronomonas pharaonis\\n[27]. This molecule was reported to accumulate in amounts over 2.5 mol per mg protein [27], which translates to about 855g of the compound per mg protein.;  Thus, the likely scenario is that under the conditions used, cells rely predominantly, if not completely, on inorganic ions to counter osmotic stress; a situation that has already been observed for Natronomonas pharaonis under other conditions [27]. Indeed, using NMR to analyze intracellular solutes (see Detection of 2-Sulfotrehalose) we were not able to detect any dissacharide.; It was previously believed that any growth medium for Natronomonas pharaonis would require the presence of leucine because of a disruption in the 2-isopropylmalate synthase gene (NP2206A) [3], which is involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid.;  Nevertheless, it is now clear that Natronomonas pharaonis is capable of growing (aerobically) on a single carbon source.; The surface represents the theoretical maximum growth of Natronomonas pharaonis as a function of two parameters: (1) the acetate to oxygen ratio and (2) the maintenance energy (in mol ATP per ODml).; It is clearly of interest to compare how the theoretical results summarized in Figure 4 compare to the real-world behavior of Natronomonas pharaonis.; Not much is currently known regarding the biochemistry of the respiratory chain of Natronomonas pharaonis.;  Because of the relatively scarce information available for Natronomonas pharaonis, the P∶O ratio that we used to calculate the maintenance energy above is actually the experimental value for the closely related Halobacterium salinarum, which was determined using oxygen pulse experiments [29], [30]. Thus, the maintenance energy value reported above is still subject to scaling.;  While the observations above, by themselves, say nothing directly about the optimality of the actual fluxes used by the cells, it is at least an argument in favor of the hypothesis that Natronomonas pharaonis, under the conditions, optimizes its metabolism with respect to growth and energy production.;  This capability is suggested by the presence of various enzymes in the genome of Natronomonas pharaonis, so we checked if it is indeed a contributing factor under the conditions used.; \\nNatronomonas pharaonis was grown on the single carbon source, acetate.;  Under the conditions used, Natronomonas pharaonis showed a very low carbon incorporation rate of approximately 35%.; We presented a genome-scale, manually curated metabolic reconstruction for the polyextremophile Natronomonas pharaonis.;  In the case of Natronomonas pharaonis, work was limited by the absence of a procedure for genetic modification.;  Accordingly, the recent development of a transformation protocol for Natronomonas pharaonis (separate publication) means that we now have a haloarchaeon for which genetic manipulation is possible and labeling experiments are relatively simple.; In order to complete a constraints-based model for Natronomonas pharaonis, we experimentally determined several physiological parameters.;  The data was integrated with the metabolic reconstruction to create a computational model that we used to analyze the behavior of Natronomonas pharaonis when grown on a single carbon source.;  This supports the hypothesis that, under simple conditions, Natronomonas pharaonis optimizes its metabolism with respect to these two objectives.;  Our eventual goal is to elucidate some of the currently unclear archaeal pathways, for example to identify the exact precursors of archaeal aromatic amino acid biosynthesis [25], and to directly measure the internal fluxes of Natronomonas pharaonis\\n[31], [32], such as in response to different stimuli.; A prior partial reconstruction of the Natronomonas pharaonis metabolic network was downloaded from the PATHNET database of the Halolex system [23], [24]. We used this as the starting point of our reconstruction.;  Since the current body of metabolic literature for Natronomonas pharaonis is still quite small, data from closely related microorganisms was used, particularly from the intensively studied halophile, Halobacterium salinarum.; For the analysis of growth, Natronomonas pharaonis strain Gabara (DSM 2160) was grown under aerobic conditions using chemically-defined media prepared according to Table 1 of Text S1 (supplementary information).; The formulation of the growth medium (Table S4) used in the analysis of aerobic growth is the result of optimizing previous synthetic media used for Natronomonas pharaonis.; The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Natronomonas pharaonis biomass was determined by adapting a procedure typically used to determe the TOC of soils.; \\nNatronomonas pharaonis was grown in larger volumes (200 ml) to mid-log phase (OD 0.3–0.4), after which cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 g, 30 min).\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Using comparative biochemical and physiological analyses, we found that mitochondrial function is maintained in the presence of H2S in sulfide spring P. mexicana but not ancestral lineages from nonsulfidic habitats due to convergent adaptations in the primary toxicity target and a major detoxification enzyme.;  For all graphs, yellow colors denote P. mexicana from H2S-rich habitats, and blue denotes P. mexicana from nonsulfidic habitats.; Based on these previous results, we hypothesized that the repeated modification of enzymes in the OxPhos and SQR pathways in P. mexicana populations from sulfidic habitats leads to an increased ability to maintain mitochondrial function in the presence of H2S.;  In the present study, we used a series of in vivo and in vitro assays to identify the functional consequences of modifications to the OxPhos and SQR pathways in evolutionarily independent population pairs of P. mexicana from adjacent sulfidic and nonsulfidic habitats that are situated in different river drainages.;  The other two P. mexicana populations from sulfidic habitats [Puyacatengo (Puy) and Pichucalco (Pich)] maintained significant COX activity even at the highest H2S concentrations, which should reduce the negative impact of H2S on cellular respiration.;  Together, these results indicate that populations of P. mexicana from sulfidic habitats can detoxify H2S at higher rates and, thus, regulate mitochondrial H2S upon environmental exposure.; Modification of the OxPhos and SQR pathways in P. mexicana suggests that mitochondrial adaptations are key to the evolution of H2S tolerance.;  Based on their functions, the OxPhos and SQR pathways undoubtedly include some major-effect genes influencing H2S tolerance in different populations of P. mexicana but tolerance—as an emergent physiological trait—is a complex trait impacted by other genes as well.; The convergent evolution of H2S tolerance in P. mexicana begs questions about the origin of adaptive alleles (20).;  To identify convergence at a genomic level, we resequenced whole genomes of multiple P. mexicana individuals from sulfidic and nonsulfidic habitats.;  Analyzing phylogenetic relationships among P. mexicana populations (with Poecilia reticulata as an outgroup) using 13,390,303 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the genome confirmed three independent colonization events of sulfide springs and distinct evolutionary trajectories for sulfide spring populations in different drainages (Fig. 2A), as inferred by previous studies (24).;  Clustering by ecotype indicates a monophyletic origin of putatively adaptive alleles at these loci that are shared across independent lineages of sulfide spring P. mexicana as a consequence of selection on standing genetic variation or introgression (25), although the latter scenario is less likely considering the geographic barriers and strong survival selection against migrants from sulfidic to nonsulfidic habitats (26).;  Consequently, multiple mechanisms—not just selection on de novo mutations (19)—played a role in the convergent evolution of H2S tolerance in P. mexicana.; (A) Phylogeny of different populations in the P. mexicana species complex (with P. reticulata as an outgroup) based on genome-wide SNPs.;  Pictures on the

sulphuraria (Pich), P. mexicana (Tac), P. mexicana (Puy), and Limia sulphurophila. (C) MDS plot of the expression of 186 genes with evidence for convergent expression shifts. (D) Boxplots with mean expression levels of different components of the SQR pathway across lineages from sulfidic (yellow) and nonsulfidic (blue) habitats.;  These findings suggest that modifications of H2S toxicity targets and detoxification pathways are not only critical in the evolution of H2S tolerance in P. mexicana, but also they have evolved in convergence in other lineages that were exposed to the same source of selection.; We capitalized on past evolutionary genetics studies that compared P. mexicana populations from sulfidic and nonsulfidic environments (10) to test hypotheses about functional ramifications of genetic differences and their impact on organismal performance.;  As predicted, we found that the repeated evolution of H2S tolerance in independent P. mexicana populations is mediated both by modifications of a direct toxicity target (causing increased resistance to H2S) and a pathway involved in detoxification (causing an increased ability to regulate mitochondrial H2S).; Samples of P. mexicana for comparative biochemical and physiological analyses were collected from three population pairs from the Tac, Puy, and Pich drainages in Mexico, each including evolutionarily independent H2S-tolerant and ancestral, intolerant populations (SI Appendix, Table S1) (34).;  Our sampling included populations of P. latipinna and G. holbrooki in Florida; populations of the P. mexicana species complex (including P. mexicana, P. sulphuraria, and Poecilia limantouri), the G. sexradiata species complex (including G. sexradiata and G. eurystoma), P. bimaculatus, and X. hellerii in Mexico; as well as populations of the Limia perugiae species complex (L. perugiae and L. sulphurophila) in the Dominican Republic (SI Appendix, Table S1).; Measurements of COX and SQR activities were conducted using isolated mitochondria from three P. mexicana population pairs and followed previously established methods.;  We used a MitoA protocol specifically validated for P. mexicana (39).; Mitochondrial function was measured in mitochondria isolated from livers from three P. mexicana population pairs.; To test hypotheses about the origin of putatively adaptive alleles, we reanalyzed data from Brown et al. (25), which included whole-genome sequences from all sites known to harbor H2S-tolerant populations of the P. mexicana species complex (n = 5) as well as adjacent nonsulfidic habitats (n = 5; SI Appendix, Table S1).;  Raw reads from transcriptome sequencing were mapped to the P. mexicana reference genome (46), and the number of RNA-sequencing reads mapped to each gene was determined for each individual using cufflinks (47).\n",

   To better understand the potential for life in these cold briny environments, we determined the maximum salt concentrations suitable for growth (MSCg) of six different chloride and perchlorate salts at 25°C and 4°C for the extremotolerant cold- and salt-adapted bacterial strain Planococcus halocryophilus.;  A model organism for halo- and psychrotolerant bacteria is Planococcus halocryophilus, which has been isolated from the active layer of permafrost soil in the Canadian High Arctic (Mykytczuk et al.,\\n2012).; The bacterial strain Planococcus halocryophilus Or1 (DSM 24743T), obtained from the DSMZ (Leibniz Institute DSMZ—German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) was used in all experiments described within this study.\n",

 Genomic and phenotypic analyses allowed us to situate this isolate inside the Pseudomonas fluorescens phylogroup of pseudomonads as well as to reveal its metabolic versatility and plasticity.;  Furthermore, Pseudomonas sp.;  On the other hand, the MPC6 genome comprised considerably less virulence and drug resistance factors as compared to pathogenic Pseudomonas strains, thus supporting its safety.;  This PHA synthase shared only 40% sequence identity at the amino acid level against the only PHA polymerase described for Pseudomonas (63-1 strain) able to produce copolymers of short- and medium-chain length PHAs.;  Batch cultures for PHA synthesis in Pseudomonas sp.;  Based on the results obtained, we conclude that Pseudomonas sp.;  Moreover, genetic elements involved in DNA repair (recBCD genes) have been shown to be essential during growth of Pseudomonas syringae at 4°C (Pavankumar et al., 2010).; In this work, we focused our attention toward a versatile Pseudomonas sp.;  Microbes of the genus Pseudomonas are well known for their high ability to colonize various ecological niches (Timmis, 2002) and resist adverse environmental conditions (Poblete-Castro et al., 2012).; In this respect, the unique phenotypes previously reported for the cold-adapted Pseudomonas sp.;  Using a combination of sequencing technologies (Illumina and PacBio), we sequenced and fully assembled the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 strain, performing a variety of genomic analyses that guided further experimental validations directed to ascertain the biotechnological potential and safety of this bacterium, as well as prompting new questions relating to molecular strategies and the lifestyle of psychrotolerant Pseudomonas.; Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (DSM 6125), Pseudomonas antarctica (DSM 15318), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (DSM 22644), Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA871), and the isolated Antarctic strains Pseudomonas sp.; To assess the growth profile of Pseudomonas sp.; For PHA synthesis, Pseudomonas sp.; Genomic DNA was extracted from an overnight culture of Pseudomonas sp.; The distance tree showing the phylogenetic relationships between MPC6 and other Pseudomonas strains at a sub-species resolution was calculated from a multiple sequence alignment generated using a core genome MLST approach, as described below.;  First, we used the tool Roary to compare the sequence of 39 Pseudomonas chromosomes (including MPC6) in order to identify a set of genes encoding proteins sharing 90% or more sequence identity among all the strains.; The identification of virulence-related genes among different Pseudomonas genomes was performed using the VFanalyzer pipeline available in the Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria (VFDB) database (Chen et al., 2015), as well as the gene classification tools available from the PATRIC database and analysis resource center (Wattam et al., 2016).;  Besides, the identification of antibiotic resistance genes in MPC6 and other Pseudomonas strains was performed using PATRIC and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) (Jia et al., 2016) tools.; Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pseudomonas sp.; We found five PhaC-like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHA) synthase-coding genes in the Pseudomonas sp.;  The following protein sequences (and its respective coding nucleotide sequence) were used: {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAM63409.1\",\"term_id\":\"21689575\",\"term_text\":\"AAM63409.1\"}}AAM63409.1 and {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAM63409.1\",\"term_id\":\"21689575\",\"term_text\":\"AAM63409.1\"}}AAM63409.1 (Pseudomonas putida KT2440);

 These sequences, along with the five Pseudomonas sp.; Pseudomonas sp.; Circular maps showing the main features of the Pseudomonas sp.; We exploited the genomic information to phylogenetically classify Pseudomonas sp.;  Only low confidence assignments were obtained, where MPC6 was identified as Pseudomonas mandelii (42% support), as Pseudomonas silesiensis (28% support), and as Pseudomonas lini and Pseudomonas prosekii with a 14% support.;  This strongly suggests that MPC6 strain is part of a new species from the genus Pseudomonas.;  The analyzed strains clustered in agreement with classifications performed in previous works, covering several of the main species phylogroups proposed to compose the genus Pseudomonas (Peix et al., 2018), including P. pertucinogena, P. stutzeri, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. syringae, and P. fluorescens.;  Pseudomonas sp.; Phylogenetic relationships between Pseudomonas sp.;  The different colors indicate the main phylogroups proposed to compose the genus Pseudomonas (Peix et al., 2018).; To get insight into the metabolic capabilities of Pseudomonas sp.;  As most bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, the Antarctic microbe MPC6 does not possess the 6-phosphofructokinase enzyme (PFK) that plays a pivotal role for the conversion of sugars via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP pathway), a process also known as glycolysis.;  The genome of Pseudomonas sp.; Reconstruction of metabolic pathways of the Antarctic Pseudomonas sp.;  This cold-adapted bacterium has various nitroreductase enzymes, which share a high amino acid sequence identity (92%) with the enzymes reported in other Pseudomonas bacteria able to reduce TNT (2,4,6-trinitritoluene).;  Genes responsible for the conversion of pentachlorophenol (PCP) were also found within the genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  We identified three genes (dhmA1, dhmA2, and dhaA) encoding for haloalkane dehalogenase enzymes in the genome of Pseudomonas MPC6, which catalyze the hydrolytic conversion of chloroalkene and nitroalkane to the corresponding alcohol and hydrogen halide (Janssen, 2004).;  As with other Pseudomonas strains, MPC6 has the capacity to produce alginate from different biosynthetic pathways such as glucose, glycerol, and fructose (Figure 3).;  Interestingly, the genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  This catalytic process is carried out by the enzymes RmlA, B, C, D, and all of them are encoded in Pseudomonas sp.; Regarding the production of polymeric substances, in a recent study (Pacheco et al., 2019) we showed that Pseudomonas sp.;  These results attest to the high capacity of Pseudomonas sp.;  The highest μmax was obtained for citrate and benzoate (Figure 4A), the preferred carbon sources for Pseudomonas strains (Rojo, 2010).;  Another important finding is that Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 could efficiently propagate on ethylene glycol as the only C source, a feature which to date, has only been reported for Pseudomonas putida JM37 (Mückschel et al., 2012), where the Antarctic strain showed a growth rate of 0.25 (1/h) (Figure 4A).; Specific growth rates of the strain Pseudomonas sp.;  As depicted in Figure 4B, Pseudomonas sp.; In order to explore the safety and pathogenic potential (Casadevall, 2017) of Pseudomonas sp.;  We identified, classified and counted putative virulence-related genes, and compared them with those of other Pseudomonas strains previously described as non-pathogenic environmental isolates (P. putida KT2440, P. antarctica PAMC 27494), isolates virulent to mammals (P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA7), or virulent to plants (P. syringae DC3000) (Figure 5).;  Key virulence factors for infection of animals present in these strains are absent in Pseudomonas sp.; Genome virulence profile of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 and other pathogenic and non-pathogenic Pseudomonas strains.;  As expected, PA7 was resistant to the highest number of antibiotics, including amikacin, ciprofloxacin and cefepime, which were effective over all the Pseudomonas strains tested.;  Conversely, Pseudomonas MPC6 was sensitive to antibiotics that were ineffective for most of the other strains, showing a similar resistant profile than the environmental isolates KT2440 and P. antartica.; Antimicrobial resistance properties of Pseudomonas sp.; Computational analyses using genomic data along with the databases CARD and PATRIC, allowed us to determine the resistome of MPC6 and the rest of the Pseudomonas strains, classifying and counting genes related to different molecular mechanisms leading to antimicrobial resistance (Figure 6B).;  Taken together, all this evidence indicates that Pseudomonas MPC6 has a low pathogenic potential and an antimicrobial resistance profile comparable to other non-virulent Pseudomonas environmental isolates.;  This supports the safety of Pseudomonas MPC6 for its usage as a valuable biotechnological tool.; Genetic organization of (A) arsenic and (B) cadmium resistance genes of the Antarctic Pseudomonas sp.;  To the best of our knowledge, Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 shows the highest MIC so far reported against AsV (350 mM) among Pseudomonas strains.;  It can also grow in the presence of high concentration of copper and AsIII, showing elevated resistance to cadmium (10 mM) as compared to other environmental Pseudomonas.;  Conversely, Pseudomonas sp.;  In this regard, the Pseudomonas sp.; Minimum inhibitory concentration of metals in Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 and highly metal resistant Pseudomonas strains.; Genes involved in cold adaptation and oxidative stress found in Pseudomonas sp.; We have recently produced a novel scl-co-mcl-PHA from glycerol in Pseudomonas sp.;  The same monomer composition was determined for PHAs synthesized from ethylene glycol, where the major monomer was C10, making the first time that this biopolymer is produced by a wild-type Pseudomonas strain using ethylene glycol as the solely C substrate.;  As the PHA synthase defines, to a great extent, the final monomer composition of the produced PHA, we compared the five PHA synthases of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 against the polymerase enzymes (PhaC) of well-studied PHA producing microbes like Bacillus megaterium, Haloferax mediterranei, Cupriavidus necator, P. putida KT2440, and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, the latter bacterium being the only Pseudomonas strain described to be capable of naturally producing scl-co-mcl-PHAs.;  Based on the amino acid sequence identity of the studied PHA synthases, phylogenetic analysis revealed that out of the five PHA synthases, one of them (PhaC5) cluster with the Class I synthases of C. necator, whereas PhaC1, PhaC2, and PhaC4 clustered closer to Class II synthases of P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 (Figure 8A).;  The PhaC3 of Pseudomonas sp.;  The multiple amino acid sequence alignment corroborates the fact that PhaC3 differs from the PhaC polymerase of C. necator, P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, showing 34.4, 40.4, and 39.9% amino acids sequence similarity, respectively (Figure 8B).; Monomer composition, biomass, and PHA titers displayed by Pseudomonas sp.;  In-depth analysis of the genome of the Pseudomonas sp.;  In this respect, phylogenetic analysis using whole genome data strongly suggests that Pseudomonas sp.;  Here, we propose the name Pseudomonas frigusceleri MPC6, due to its outstanding ability to proliferate and produce valuable compounds at temperatures near to 0°C.;  Furthermore, this isolate clustered inside the Pseudomonas fluorescens phylogroup, which encompasses most of the Pseudomonas environmental strains described so far, isolated from very diverse habitats.;  This points to the extreme diversity of bacteria classified as Pseudomonas, one of the most extensive bacterial genera described so far comprising more than 200 species (Gomila et al., 2015; Peix et al., 2018).; As reported for several bacterial strains of the genus, Pseudomonas sp.;  However, Pseudomonas strains isolated so far from Antarctic territory have not shown these metabolic capabilities, and even though they can metabolize various C6 carbon sugars, none of them are able to catabolize xylose or arabinose (Lustman et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017).;  Few Pseudomonas bacteria have been reported to harbor genes to oxidize As(III) to As(V) (Ghosh et al., 2015), where both models strains P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 are only able to reduce or expel arsenate(V) from the cell (Fernández et al., 2016; Fekih et al., 2018), the most abundant arsenic form in nature.;  Moreover, Pseudomonas sp.;  Bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus normally display a mechanism where cadmium is first accumulated within the cell (Lee et al., 2001), and its toxicity is further reduced by the action of polyphosphates and cysteine-rich proteins (Higham et al., 1984;

 Genomic and phenotypic analyses allowed us to situate this isolate inside the Pseudomonas fluorescens phylogroup of pseudomonads as well as to reveal its metabolic versatility and plasticity.;  Furthermore, Pseudomonas sp.;  On the other hand, the MPC6 genome comprised considerably less virulence and drug resistance factors as compared to pathogenic Pseudomonas strains, thus supporting its safety.;  This PHA synthase shared only 40% sequence identity at the amino acid level against the only PHA polymerase described for Pseudomonas (63-1 strain) able to produce copolymers of short- and medium-chain length PHAs.;  Batch cultures for PHA synthesis in Pseudomonas sp.;  Based on the results obtained, we conclude that Pseudomonas sp.;  Moreover, genetic elements involved in DNA repair (recBCD genes) have been shown to be essential during growth of Pseudomonas syringae at 4°C (Pavankumar et al., 2010).; In this work, we focused our attention toward a versatile Pseudomonas sp.;  Microbes of the genus Pseudomonas are well known for their high ability to colonize various ecological niches (Timmis, 2002) and resist adverse environmental conditions (Poblete-Castro et al., 2012).; In this respect, the unique phenotypes previously reported for the cold-adapted Pseudomonas sp.;  Using a combination of sequencing technologies (Illumina and PacBio), we sequenced and fully assembled the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp.; Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (DSM 6125), Pseudomonas antarctica (DSM 15318), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (DSM 22644), Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA871), and the isolated Antarctic strains Pseudomonas sp.; To assess the growth profile of Pseudomonas sp.; For PHA synthesis, Pseudomonas sp.; Genomic DNA was extracted from an overnight culture of Pseudomonas sp.; The distance tree showing the phylogenetic relationships between MPC6 and other Pseudomonas strains at a sub-species resolution was calculated from a multiple sequence alignment generated using a core genome MLST approach, as described below.;  First, we used the tool Roary to compare the sequence of 39 Pseudomonas chromosomes (including MPC6) in order to identify a set of genes encoding proteins sharing 90% or more sequence identity among all the strains.; The identification of virulence-related genes among different Pseudomonas genomes was performed using the VFanalyzer pipeline available in the Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria (VFDB) database (Chen et al., 2015), as well as the gene classification tools available from the PATRIC database and analysis resource center (Wattam et al., 2016).;  Besides, the identification of antibiotic resistance genes in MPC6 and other Pseudomonas strains was performed using PATRIC and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) (Jia et al., 2016) tools.; Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pseudomonas sp.; We found five PhaC-like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHA) synthase-coding genes in the Pseudomonas sp.;  The following protein sequences (and its respective coding nucleotide sequence) were used: {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAM63409.1\",\"term_id\":\"21689575\",\"term_text\":\"AAM63409.1\"}}AAM63409.1 and {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAM63409.1\",\"term_id\":\"21689575\",\"term_text\":\"AAM63409.1\"}}AAM63409.1 (Pseudomonas putida KT2440);

 These sequences, along with the five Pseudomonas sp.; Pseudomonas sp.; Circular maps showing the main features of the Pseudomonas sp.; We exploited the genomic information to phylogenetically classify Pseudomonas sp.;  Only low confidence assignments were obtained, where MPC6 was identified as Pseudomonas mandelii (42% support), as Pseudomonas silesiensis (28% support), and as Pseudomonas lini and Pseudomonas prosekii with a 14% support.;  The analyzed strains clustered in agreement with classifications performed in previous works, covering several of the main species phylogroups proposed to compose the genus Pseudomonas (Peix et al., 2018), including P. pertucinogena, P. stutzeri, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. syringae, and P. fluorescens.;  Pseudomonas sp.; Phylogenetic relationships between Pseudomonas sp.;  The different colors indicate the main phylogroups proposed to compose the genus Pseudomonas (Peix et al., 2018).; To get insight into the metabolic capabilities of Pseudomonas sp.;  The genome of Pseudomonas sp.; Reconstruction of metabolic pathways of the Antarctic Pseudomonas sp.;  This cold-adapted bacterium has various nitroreductase enzymes, which share a high amino acid sequence identity (92%) with the enzymes reported in other Pseudomonas bacteria able to reduce TNT (2,4,6-trinitritoluene).;  Genes responsible for the conversion of pentachlorophenol (PCP) were also found within the genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  We identified three genes (dhmA1, dhmA2, and dhaA) encoding for haloalkane dehalogenase enzymes in the genome of Pseudomonas MPC6, which catalyze the hydrolytic conversion of chloroalkene and nitroalkane to the corresponding alcohol and hydrogen halide (Janssen, 2004).;  As with other Pseudomonas strains, MPC6 has the capacity to produce alginate from different biosynthetic pathways such as glucose, glycerol, and fructose (Figure 3).;  Interestingly, the genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  This catalytic process is carried out by the enzymes RmlA, B, C, D, and all of them are encoded in Pseudomonas sp.; Regarding the production of polymeric substances, in a recent study (Pacheco et al., 2019) we showed that Pseudomonas sp.;  These results attest to the high capacity of Pseudomonas sp.;  The highest μmax was obtained for citrate and benzoate (Figure 4A), the preferred carbon sources for Pseudomonas strains (Rojo, 2010).;  Another important finding is that Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 could efficiently propagate on ethylene glycol as the only C source, a feature which to date, has only been reported for Pseudomonas putida JM37 (Mückschel et al., 2012), where the Antarctic strain showed a growth rate of 0.25 (1/h) (Figure 4A).; Specific growth rates of the strain Pseudomonas sp.;  As depicted in Figure 4B, Pseudomonas sp.; In order to explore the safety and pathogenic potential (Casadevall, 2017) of Pseudomonas sp.;  We identified, classified and counted putative virulence-related genes, and compared them with those of other Pseudomonas strains previously described as non-pathogenic environmental isolates (P. putida KT2440, P. antarctica PAMC 27494), isolates virulent to mammals (P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA7), or virulent to plants (P. syringae DC3000) (Figure 5).;  Key virulence factors for infection of animals present in these strains are absent in Pseudomonas sp.; Genome virulence profile of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 and other pathogenic and non-pathogenic Pseudomonas strains.;  As expected, PA7 was resistant to the highest number of antibiotics, including amikacin, ciprofloxacin and cefepime, which were effective over all the Pseudomonas strains tested.;  Conversely, Pseudomonas MPC6 was sensitive to antibiotics that were ineffective for most of the other strains, showing a similar resistant profile than the environmental isolates KT2440 and P. antartica.; Antimicrobial resistance properties of Pseudomonas sp.; Computational analyses using genomic data along with the databases CARD and PATRIC, allowed us to determine the resistome of MPC6 and the rest of the Pseudomonas strains, classifying and counting genes related to different molecular mechanisms leading to antimicrobial resistance (Figure 6B).;  Taken together, all this evidence indicates that Pseudomonas MPC6 has a low pathogenic potential and an antimicrobial resistance profile comparable to other non-virulent Pseudomonas environmental isolates.;  This supports the safety of Pseudomonas MPC6 for its usage as a valuable biotechnological tool.; Genetic organization of (A) arsenic and (B) cadmium resistance genes of the Antarctic Pseudomonas sp.;  To the best of our knowledge, Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 shows the highest MIC so far reported against AsV (350 mM) among Pseudomonas strains.;  Conversely, Pseudomonas sp.;  In this regard, the Pseudomonas sp.; Minimum inhibitory concentration of metals in Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 and highly metal resistant Pseudomonas strains.; Genes involved in cold adaptation and oxidative stress found in Pseudomonas sp.; We have recently produced a novel scl-co-mcl-PHA from glycerol in Pseudomonas sp.;  The same monomer composition was determined for PHAs synthesized from ethylene glycol, where the major monomer was C10, making the first time that this biopolymer is produced by a wild-type Pseudomonas strain using ethylene glycol as the solely C substrate.;  As the PHA synthase defines, to a great extent, the final monomer composition of the produced PHA, we compared the five PHA synthases of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 against the polymerase enzymes (PhaC) of well-studied PHA producing microbes like Bacillus megaterium, Haloferax mediterranei, Cupriavidus necator, P. putida KT2440, and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, the latter bacterium being the only Pseudomonas strain described to be capable of naturally producing scl-co-mcl-PHAs.;  Based on the amino acid sequence identity of the studied PHA synthases, phylogenetic analysis revealed that out of the five PHA synthases, one of them (PhaC5) cluster with the Class I synthases of C. necator, whereas PhaC1, PhaC2, and PhaC4 clustered closer to Class II synthases of P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 (Figure 8A).;  The PhaC3 of Pseudomonas sp.;  The multiple amino acid sequence alignment corroborates the fact that PhaC3 differs from the PhaC polymerase of C. necator, P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, showing 34.4, 40.4, and 39.9% amino acids sequence similarity, respectively (Figure 8B).; Monomer composition, biomass, and PHA titers displayed by Pseudomonas sp.;  In-depth analysis of the genome of the Pseudomonas sp.;  In this respect, phylogenetic analysis using whole genome data strongly suggests that Pseudomonas sp.;  Here, we propose the name Pseudomonas frigusceleri MPC6, due to its outstanding ability to proliferate and produce valuable compounds at temperatures near to 0°C.;  Furthermore, this isolate clustered inside the Pseudomonas fluorescens phylogroup, which encompasses most of the Pseudomonas environmental strains described so far, isolated from very diverse habitats.; As reported for several bacterial strains of the genus, Pseudomonas sp.;  However, Pseudomonas strains isolated so far from Antarctic territory have not shown these metabolic capabilities, and even though they can metabolize various C6 carbon sugars, none of them are able to catabolize xylose or arabinose (Lustman et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017).;  Few Pseudomonas bacteria have been reported to harbor genes to oxidize As(III) to As(V) (Ghosh et al., 2015), where both models strains P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 are only able to reduce or expel arsenate(V) from the cell (Fernández et al., 2016; Fekih et al., 2018), the most abundant arsenic form in nature.;  Moreover, Pseudomonas sp.;  Bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus normally display a mechanism where cadmium is first accumulated within the cell (Lee et al., 2001), and its toxicity is further reduced by the action of polyphosphates and cysteine-rich proteins (Higham et al., 1984; Wang and Crowley, 2005).; One of the most remarkable characteristics of Pseudomonas sp.;  Taking this into account, the MPC6 strain has evolved to colonize those niches with fluctuating temperatures, but what genetic means makes this versatile bacterium so different from other cold-adapted Pseudomonas bacteria? It has been proposed that high copy number of tRNAs contribute to the survival of psychrophiles in response to low temperatures (Methé et al., 2005).;  We excluded this possibility in MPC6 since the numbers of tRNAs found in this Antarctic bacteria do not differ from those observed in mesophilic Pseudomonas strains (Nelson et al., 2002; Vizoso et al., 2015).;  Additionally, the unaltered ratio of lysine/arginine and enhanced proline content found in the genome of Pseudomonas sp.;  MPC6 in comparison to mesophilic Pseudomonas indicates that other genetic elements govern the adaptation of the MPC6 strain under low temperatures.;  On the other hand, we showed that Pseudomonas sp.; Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the new species of pseudomonad, Pseudomonas frigusceleri MPC6 strain, is genetically well equipped for cold adaptation, shows a reduced pathogenic and antibiotic resistance potential, and exhibits attributes that hold promising biotechnological applications such as bioremediation at low temperature of arsenic, cadmium, alkanes, and chloro- and nitro-aromatics compounds, as well as the synthesis of biopolymers such as alginate and novel PHAs from renewable sources.\n",

                                                       This study demonstrated that muscle protein hydrolysate from S. japonicus has strong antioxidant activities.; Previously, we reported on the production of S. japonicus protein hydrolysates using proteases (Alcalase, Neutrase, and Protamex).; The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidative potential of the S. japonicus protein hydrolysates fed to mice with alcoholic fatty liver disease.;  Therefore, S. japonicus has potential for use in the development of bioactive compounds.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Both observations suggest the implication of citric acid in Cd, Ni translocation and shoot accumulation in S. portulacastrum.;  The relatively high accumulation of citric acid in xylem sap and shoot of S. portulacastrum could be involved in metal chelation and thus contributes to heavy metal tolerance in this species.;  The aim of this work was therefore to study the relation between the accumulation of cadmium and nickel applied separately or concomitantly and organic acids concentrations in roots, shoots and xylem sap to confirm the possible implication of these compounds in the translocation and sequestration of heavy metals in the halophyte species of S. portulacastrum.; The effect of Cd and Ni applied separately or together on S. portulacastrum development was evaluated based on fresh biomass production after 21 days of treatment.; The variation of Cd and Ni concentrations in the shoots and the roots of S. portulacastrum cultivated during 21 days in the presence of 50 μM Cd and 100 μM Ni applied separately or together are given in Figure ​Figure22.; Variation in Cd concentrations in shoots (A) and roots (B) and Ni concentrations in shoots (C) and roots (D) in S. portulacastrum cultivated during 21 days under different treatments: control without metal; 50 μM Cd; 100 μM Ni and the combination of (50 μM Cd + 100 μM Ni).;  The Cd and Ni concentrations in xylem sap of S. portulacastrum exposed to 50 μM Cd and 100 μM Ni were 1300 and 1450 μg L-1, respectively.; Cadmium (A) and Nickel (B) concentrations in xylem saps of S. portulacastrum subjected during 21 days to different treatments.; In order to evaluate the possible implication of organic acids in Cd and Ni, translocation and/or chelation and tolerance in S. portulacastrum, we estimated the concentrations of these compounds in tissues of plant cultivated under different treatments (Figures ​Figures44 and ​and55).; Concentrations of organic acids in roots of S. portulacastrum subjected during 21 days to different treatments.; Concentrations of organic acids in shoots of S. portulacastrum grown in control and subjected during 21 days at different metal treatments.; The addition of 50 μM Cd and 100 μM Ni alone or in combination reduced the malic acid concentration in the roots (Figure ​Figure44) and in the shoots (Figure ​Figure55) of S. portulacastrum.;  The determination of organic acid concentrations in the xylem sap (Figure ​Figure66) showed that malic, ascorbic, and fumaric acids were detectable in the xylem sap of control and metal-treated S. portulacastrum plants.; Concentrations of organic acids in xylem saps of S. portulacastrum grown during 21 days on control and metal enriched solutions.;  Hence it has been demonstrated that S. portulacastrum, for example, is able to accumulate Cd and Pb in the shoots without significant growth reduction (Ghnaya et al., 2005; Zaier et al., 2010).;  In our study, we showed that S. portulacastrum is able to accumulate Cd and Ni which confirm the previous results published by Ghnaya et al. (2005, 2007) and Zaier et al. (2010, 2014) demonstrating that this species adopts the second strategy.; Previous studies reported that S. portulacastrum is able to accumulate Cd, Pb, and As at levels to characteristic of accumulator plant species (Ghnaya et al., 2005, 2013; Zaier et al., 2010; Lokhande et al., 2011; Wali et al., 2014).; The evaluation of the Pb translocation and accumulation in S. portulacastrum and the possible implication of organic acids in these processes were studied by Ghnaya et al. (2013).;  Hence, the high potential of Cd and Ni translocation and shoot accumulation exhibited by S. portulacastrum could be related and governed by the higher citrate levels present in leaf cells as previously shown in studies on Pb translocation and accumulation (Zaier et al., 2010; Ghnaya et al., 2013).; Taken together the results obtained in this work indicated that 50 μM Cd does not induce significant change in the growth of the halophyte S. portulacastrum which should be related to the tolerance of this species against some heavy metals.\n",

 Remarkably, we demonstrated that a full-length mutant of gene, named framefucA, obtained by inserting specific site-directed mutations in the fucA gene in the positions that were predicted to generate by −1 PRF a complete polypeptide (Figure 1B) led to a functional enzyme α-l-fucosidase, named Ssα-fuc, of 495 amino acids, which resulted in it being thermophilic, thermostable, and having an unusual nonameric structure [16,17,18,19,22]. In addition, we showed that fucA is expressed by −1 PRF in both E. coli and S. solfataricus demonstrating, for the first time, that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea [20]. To date, only 8 archaeal α-l-fucosidases are reported and that from S. solfataricus is the only one characterized.;  It is interesting to note that the S. solfataricus strains P2 and 98/2, although isolated in the Pisciarelli solfataric field in Italy and in the Yellowstone National Park, respectively, shows the same interruption, suggesting a conserved regulating mechanism for this gene organization.;  In Archaea, several functional interrupted genes have been identified in S. solfataricus [26]. Increasing evidence suggests that the flexibility of the genetic code decoding is a trait selected during evolution that may increase microbial fitness under certain conditions [27]. This could be particularly relevant in extreme environments, which, contrary to common believe, are not immutable but subjected to sudden changes that greatly, and temporarily, modify the chemical-physical parameters and to which microorganisms must adapt.; The essentiality of the α-l-fucosidase gene in S. solfataricus was analyzed by preparing a deletion mutant PBL2025:ΔSSO3060-{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"SSO11867\",\"term_id\":\"1429203988\"}}SSO11867 (Del) and comparing it with the parental wild type (WT) and PBL2025 (a S. solfataricus strain deleted of 50 genes, from ORFs SSO3004 to SSO3050, many of which encode for carbohydrate-active enzymes) strains in standard conditions.;  As reported in Figure 2A, the Del strain is viable, clearly indicating that fucA is not an essential gene for S. solfataricus grown in this condition.;  In order to analyse the effect of the presence of a full-length gene, not regulated by −1PRF, we prepared a mutant strain of S. solfataricus in which the interrupted wild type fucA gene was substituted with the full-length mutant framefucA (FFuc strain).;  The high apparent molecular weight of the bands in lanes 3–4 is due to the higher stability of the nonameric structure of the enzyme in the S. solfataricus extract if compared to the purified recombinant α-l-fucosidase, as already reported [20,22]. As reported previously [20], unspecific signals for bands lower than 97 kDa and a very faint band visible in the Del lane, were detected.; S. solfataricus wild type and mutant strains. (A) Representative growth curves of S. solfataricus wild type (WT), PBL2025, Del and FFuc strains (red, blue, green and black lines, respectively) in YCS medium at 80 °C.; Comparison of S. solfataricus wild type and FFuc strains. (A) Contrast phase microscopy of of WT and FFuc cell cultures harvested in late exponential phase; (B) Transcriptional analysis of fucA and framefucA mRNA in S. solfataricus WT and FFuc strains, respectively, analyzed by real-time PCR.; It has already been well documented that PRF increases the coding potential of the genome, it is often used to ensure a defined stoichiometry of protein products, to expand the variability of cellular proteomes or adapt to changing environments [27]. The special living conditions of Archaea, in particular of S. solfataricus growing at T = 80 °C and pH 3.0–5.0 in geothermal sites, make this organism an interesting model system to study whether translational recoding is involved in adaptations to extreme environment, stress responses and changing growth conditions.;  To evaluate the effect of the natural environment we exposed the wild type laboratory strain to a water-mud pool in the Pisciarelli solfataric field (Figure 6), where it was originally isolated [31]. The S. solfataricus grown in the laboratory up to 0.17 OD600nm was divided into 3 groups of sample cultures incubated as follows: (i) in the Pisciarelli solfatara using tubes capped with a 0.22 µm filter, which allowed the exchange of trace elements present in the solfatara water, but not of microorganisms and sediments; (ii) in the lab in the same tubes, but in a shaker at 80 °C; (iii) in the lab in a standard laboratory flask at 80 °C, in a shaker.;  In fact, it has been reported that the stress induced by UV irradiation of S. solfataricus induces an archaeal pili system, which mediates cellular aggregation in response to UV damage [32,33].; Growth of S. solfataricus in solfatara Pisciarelli.

(A) Growth curve of S. solfataricus WT strain at 80 °C (blue) and subjected to cold shock at 65 and 4 °C (red and green, respectively).;  Statistical significance was performed using the two-tailed paired Student’s t test (* p < 0.05) and ANOVA Dunnett’s test (p < 0.0013). (D) Activity assays on WT and FFuc S. solfataricus cellular extracts on 4NP-α-l-fucopyranoside.; Following these results, we decided to evaluate the effect of UV irradiation, another stressor commonly used for S. solfataricus [36,37] on both strains.; Response of S. solfataricus to UV irradiation. (A) Representative growth curve of S. solfataricus WT (blue lines) and FFuc (green lines) in standard conditions and after UV irradiation. (B) Contrast phase microscopy of cell cultures harvested after 50 h. (C) Real-time PCR of fucA and framefucA mRNA.; S. solfataricus possesses a broad capacity for the degradation of different polymeric sugars as documented by the presence of 28 glycoside hydrolases in its genome (according to http://www.cazy.org (accessed on 4 March 2021)) [39,40]. Plant material originating from woodland areas surrounding Pisciarelli solfatara [41], mainly contribute to the presence of different polysaccharides and glycoconjugates in the organism’s natural habitat.;  Thus, S. solfataricus adapted its metabolism to these environmental conditions, but relatively little is known about the function of these enzymes in vivo.;  However, several genes encoding for glycosyl hydrolases, namely an α-glucosidase (SSO3051), a β-glucuronidase (SSO3036), a β-xylosidase (SSO3032), and the clustered α-xylosidase (XylS) and α-glycosidase (Ssβ-gly) (SSO3022 and SSO3019, respectively), map close to fucA and are likely to be involved in the degradation of polysaccharides for energy metabolism [42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49]. To evaluate whether the transcription and the translation of the fucA gene could be affected by growing S. solfataricus with different carbon sources, the WT and FFuc strains were grown in rich and minimal media supplemented with different sugars.; S. solfataricus strains growth with different carbon sources. (A) Representative growth curves of S. solfataricus WT strain in different media: YCS (blu), YCF (black), Minimal Medium + Sucrose (red), Minimal Medium + Fucose (green) and Minimal Medium + Hydrolyzed Xyloglucan (orange).;  Data are representative of three independent growth curves and are expressed as the mean ± SD. (B) Representative growth curves of S. solfataricus FFuc strain in different media: YCS (blu), YCF (black), Minimal Medium+ Sucrose (red), Minimal Medium + Fucose (green) and Minimal Medium + Hydrolyzed Xyloglucan (orange). (C) Real-time PCR of fucA and framefucA mRNA.;  Statistical significance was performed using the two-tailed paired Student’s t test (* p < 0.05) and ANOVA Dunnett’s test (p < 0.0001). (D) Activity assays on WT and FFuc S. solfataricus cellular extracts on 4NP-α-l-fucopyranoside.;  However, the physiological significance of PRF has been assigned only to a minority of the cellular genes while for most of them it is still uncertain [1,6,13,14,50]. The reason why fucA expression is regulated by −1 PRF in S. solfataricus is not known.; To get more insights into the mechanism of regulation of fucA in S. solfataricus, we compared the transcript level and the α-l-fucosidase activity of the WT strain with those of the FFuc strain in which fucA, being full-length (framefucA), is not under the regulation of −1 PRF.;  Several α-l-fucosidases belonging to glycoside hydrolases family GH29 in the Carbohydrate Active enZYmes database (http://www.cazy.org/ (accessed on 4 March 2021)) [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58]. In addition, we have previously reported that in S. solfataricus the α-xylosidase XylS and the β-glycosidase Ssβ-gly, hydrolyzed tamarind seed xyloglucan oligosaccharides in vitro [48]. More recently, we observed that the α-l-fucosidase is able to remove the fucose residues from fucosylated xyloglucan oligosaccharides [59], suggesting that the three enzymes cooperate for the hydrolysis of xyloglucan oligosaccharides [17] like it has been suggested in T. maritima [49].; S. solfataricus strain P2 (DSM1617) and strain 98/2 (PBL2000) were considered indifferently as wild type strains [61].; S. solfataricus strain PBL2025 is a natural deletion mutant of strain 98/2, in which a fragment of about 50 kb of the chromosome containing ~50 ORFs (SSO3004-3050) is missing [62].; Unless otherwise indicated, S. solfataricus strains were grown at 80 °C, pH 3.5 in Brock’s salt medium supplemented with yeast extract, sucrose, and casamino acids (0.1% each) [60]. The growth of cells was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm and the cells were harvested at the early stationary phase (0.7–1.0 OD) by centrifugation at 5000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.; S. solfataricus wild type, grown up to 0.17 OD600nmin 100 mL of YCS in long neck flasks, was divided into 3 samples: (i) in the first sample, the culture was incubated in the Pisciarelli solfatara by using tubes having a 0.22 µm filter at the top of the cap, which allowed the exchange of trace elements present in the solfatara water but not of microorganisms and sediments; (ii) in the second sample the cells were incubated in the same tubes but in controlled conditions (in the lab); (iii) in the third sample the cells were incubated in controlled conditions (in the lab) but in a standard laboratory 250 mL flask.; For each culture, S. solfataricus WT and FFuc strains were inoculated in long neck flasks in 100 mL of YCS.; S. solfataricus WT and FFuc strains were inoculated in long neck flasks in 100 mL of YCS and incubated at 80 °C, pH 3.5 and under shaking at 160 rpm overnight (ON).; S. solfataricus WT and FFuc strains were grown in 100 mL of YCS up to 0.4–0.5 OD600.; Total cellular RNA was extracted from S. solfataricus WT and FFuc cells, according to the Qiagen’s RNeasy mini protocol, with a DNase step treatment, at 37 °C for 20 min, when necessary.; S. solfataricus cells were lysed as described above and lysates were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck-Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).; α-l-fucosidase activity assay was performed at 75 °C in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, using 4-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucopyranoside (4NP-α-l-Fuc) substrate at the final concentration of 4 mM and different amount of S. solfataricus WT and FFuc cellular extracts.;  Several functional interrupted genes were identified in S. solfataricus [26] suggesting that in Archaea, more genes could be regulated by translational recoding, such as those in viral genomes or encoding for proteins with no enzymatic activity, but that have not yet been identified, possibly because of the difficulty of isolating and characterizing them.\n",

The presence of a signal peptide indicates that SSO1949 is a secreted protein, which enables S. solfataricus to use cellulose as an external carbon source.;  The genome of S. solfataricus has been sequenced, and three genes (sso1354, sso1949 and sso2534) encoding potentially secreted endo-β-glucanases of GH family 12 are found in the genome [13]. The protein SSO2534 has been characterized and is active at approx. pH 5.8 [14].; In the present study, we report the cloning, expression, purification and characterization of the endo-β-glucanase encoded by gene sso1949 from the thermoacidophilic archaeon S. solfataricus P2.; Genomic DNA of S. solfataricus was isolated from a 5 ml culture of S. solfataricus by CTAB\\n(hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) extraction.; The gene sso1949 of the completely sequenced genome of S. solfataricus P2 has been predicted to encode an endo-β-glucanase [13]. SignalP analysis [19] indicates the presence of a signal peptide for amino acid positions 1–24, suggesting that SSO1949 is a secreted enzyme.; (A) Aligned are the catalytic modules of the cellulases from Rhodothermus marinus (Protein Data Bank no. 1H0B) [9], T. reesei (PDB no. 1H8V) [8], Streptomyces lividans (PDB no. 2NLR) [7] and S. solfataricus SSO1949.;  The alignment also includes the extremely acidophilic xylanase from A. kawachii (PDB no. 1BK1) [24]. This enzyme belongs to the GH family 11, which has a fold similar to the GH family 12 [4]. For the acidophilic enzymes from S. solfataricus and Aspergillus kawachii, residues within 0.5 nm of the catalytic glutamate residues are underlined.;  The alignment of the two acidophilic enzymes along with the neutral cellulases does not reveal any particular amino acid which could be responsible for the low pH optimum of the S. solfataricus enzyme. (B) The structure of SSO1949 was modelled with ESyPred3D [21] using the cellulase from R. marinus (PDB no. 1H0B) as template.; The gene sso1949 from the crenarchaeote S. solfataricus encodes a thermoacidophilic endo-β-glucanase, which is remarkably active and stable at acidic pH and high temperatures.;  This enzyme has a high temperature optimum at 100 °C, but in contrast with the enzyme from S. solfataricus it is most active in the neutral pH range, i.e. at pH 6.0 [22]. The preferred substrates of SSO1949 are higher cello-oligomers.; S. solfataricus is a thermoacidophile growing optimally at approx. 80 °C and pH 2– 4.;  By this mechanism, the extracellular SSO1949 might enable S. solfataricus to use cellulose as carbon and energy source.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) was isolated in acidic hot springs where it infects the archeon Sulfolobus solfataricus.;  We determined the STIV structure using near-atomic resolution electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography allowing tracing of structural polypeptide chains and visualization of transmembrane proteins embedded in the viral membrane.;  STIV shares the same coat subunit and penton base protein folds as some eukaryotic and bacterial viruses, suggesting that they derive from a common ancestor predating the divergence of the three kingdoms of life.;  Based on these results, viruses harboring this double jelly-roll fold are proposed to be in the PRD1-Adenovirus lineage that comprises Adenovirus (5–7), Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) (8), vaccinia virus (9), Sputnik (10), PRD1 (11, 12), PM2 (13), virus—Salisaeta icosahedral phage 1 (SSIP-1) (4), P23-77 (14), Bam35 (15), SH1 (16), Haloarcula hispanica icosahedral virus 2 (HHIV-2) (17), and Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) (18).; STIV infects the hyperthermo-acidophilic archeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, which grows optimally at pH 3 and 80 °C (19).;  STIV is a 75-MDa icosahedral virus that has a 17.6-kbp circular dsDNA genome encoding 36 predicted ORFs and nine structural proteins (19, 22).;  Electron microscopy and mass-spectrometry of virions, as well as crystallographic studies of its major capsid subunit, demonstrated that STIV is formed by a proteinaceous icosahedral capsid with turrets at its vertices.;  At the end of the infection cycle, STIV particles induce host lysis and are released through pyramid-like structures perforating the S-layer at the cell surface (24, 26).;  This stunning virus exit mechanism is unique to the archaeal world and has only been observed for Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus (SIRV2) in addition to STIV (27).; Despite extensive efforts carried out to decipher the STIV life cycle, little is known about the detailed architecture of this large membrane-containing virion or that of any related archaeal viruses.;  We report here the atomic structure of the mature STIV virion obtained by a combination of high-resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy and X-ray crystallography.;  Finally, comparisons of the different STIV structural proteins lead us to posit that the single ancestral virus jelly-roll module may have given rise to the STIV virion via duplication and diversification events.; We obtained the structure of the mature STIV virion using near-atomic resolution single-particle electron microscopy assisted by X-ray crystallography of isolated capsid gene products.; STIV virions have a total radius of 480 Å comprising an icosahedral capsid with a radius of 365 Å decorated with a turret structure at each fivefold vertex that extends 115 Å above the capsid (Fig. 1A).; Near-atomic resolution electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of STIV. (A) The overall virus reconstruction is displayed with the different protein components individually colored (B345, light blue; A223, light pink; C381, purple) and with an icosahedral cage overlaid onto it. (B) Blow-up view of an icosahedral face with one capsid icosahedral asymmetric unit colored as in A and labeled (1–5 for the trimeric B345 capsomers and P for the A223 penton base). (C) Cross-section of the reconstruction revealing the presence of the viral membrane (gold) and the internal genome (red).;  As for all other viruses of the PRD1-Adenovirus lineage, the STIV B345 coat subunit capsomers are organized in trimers with quasi-sixfold appearance (Fig. 1B) due to the presence of two radially oriented jelly-rolls in each subunit (Fig. 2 B and D) (5–8, 13, 18, 30).;  A previously reported STIV reconstruction at 27 Å resolution supports such an interaction with the helices pointing down and contacting the membrane (19, 23).;  This pore constitutes the first internal layer and is reminiscent of the bacterial toxin α-hemolysin (32) although that pore is spanning a cytoplasmic membrane whereas in STIV it is exposed to the solvent just underneath the capsid.;  We then used rigid-body fitting to place the coordinates into the STIV cryoEM map.;  Based on these findings and on their exposed location, we hypothesize that the C381 turret proteins act as the STIV receptor-binding proteins carrying out recognition and attachment to the host receptors.; STIV possesses an internal membrane vesicle located beneath the coat subunit shell and encapsulating the dsDNA genome.;  Sequence analysis using the TMHMM server (37) suggested that two out of the nine STIV structural proteins are likely to contain transmembrane helices: A55 and B130.; We described the atomic structure of mature STIV using a combination of cryoEM and X-ray crystallography.;  Previously, we demonstrated with electron cryotomography that STIV initially assembles as an empty procapsid that subsequently serves as a container for genome packaging (24).;  Following procapsid formation in the cytoplasm, genome packaging would occur via yet uncharacterized mechanisms to yield mature STIV virions organized in quasi-crystalline arrays while awaiting release through the pyramids puncturing the host membrane and the S-layer (24, 26).;  As no change in the overall capsid structure and dimensions was detected between the procapsid and capsid states in the tomographic studies (24), we postulate that STIV undergoes a limited maturation compared with tailed phages, for instance (38).;  Some aspects of the particle structure apply to only a subset of the viruses, such as the presence of an internal lipid-membrane in STIV, PRD1, and PM2 or the conserved structure of the Adenovirus and PRD1 spike shafts.;  This observation suggests the possibility that STIV, PRD1-like phages, and Adenovirus all derive from a common viral ancestor present in the biosphere more than 3 billion years ago, before the divergence of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.;  The structural results presented here reveal that the STIV coat subunit, penton base, and turret proteins are made of a succession of fused jelly-roll motifs.;  Based on these observations, we speculate that a unique ancestral protein module gave rise to many of the STIV structural proteins by duplication and sequence diversification events that occurred during a lengthy evolutionary process.;  If this hypothesis is correct, a single primordial jelly-roll motif led to a 75-MDa viral molecular machine tuned to withstand the extreme conditions of pH and temperature to which STIV is exposed during its life cycle.; Assembly of the STIV virion from a single protein module.;  We therefore propose that a unique ancestral protein module gave rise to many of the STIV structural proteins by duplication and sequence diversification events.;  The reconstruction was performed with Frealign (42) using the previously reported STIV reconstruction low-pass filtered at 50 Å (23).;  Model building was achieved by rigid-body fitting of individual crystal structures into the STIV reconstruction as well as de novo modeling using Chimera (43) and Coot (44).\n",

crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.;  Different steps of the N-glycosylation pathway of the closely related crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have been studied in detail (Meyer and Albers 2013).; \\nSulfolobus acidocaldarius background strain MW001 (ΔpyrE) (Wagner et al. 2012) and the genetically-modified strains S. acidocaldarius BM-A120-124 (see Table 1) were grown under shaking conditions in Brock medium at 79 °C, pH 3, and supplemented with 0.1% w/v NZ amine and 0.1% w/v dextrin as carbon and energy source (Brock et al. 1972).\n",

harboring this double jelly-roll fold are proposed to be in the PRD1-Adenovirus lineage that comprises Adenovirus (5–7), Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) (8), vaccinia virus (9), Sputnik (10), PRD1 (11, 12), PM2 (13), virus—Salisaeta icosahedral phage 1 (SSIP-1) (4), P23-77 (14), Bam35 (15), SH1 (16), Haloarcula hispanica icosahedral virus 2 (HHIV-2) (17), and Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) (18).;  The Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus cryoEM reconstruction has been deposited in the EMDataBank (accession no.\n",

                                            In this study, we performed a global quantitative proteomic analysis under extreme temperatures, pH, hydrostatic pressure (HP), and salinity on an archaeal strain, Thermococcus eurythermalis A501, which has outstanding growth capability on a wide range of temperatures (50–100°C), pH (4–9), and HPs (0.1–70 MPa), but a narrow range of NaCl (1.0–5.0 %, w/v).;  Thermococcus eurythermalis A501 is one such example, which can grow within a range over 50°C (50–100°C), 5 pH units (4.0–9.0), and 700 barometric pressure (0.1–70 MPa), although with a narrow range on NaCl (1.0–5.0 %, w/v) (Zhao et al., 2015).; Summary of growth profiles and differential expressed proteins (DEPs) in quantitative proteomic analysis of Thermococcus eurythermalis A501.; Thermococcus eurythermalis A501 was cultured separately in quadruplicates for each condition, and cells were harvested as described by Moon et al.

                                                          DrBCAT shows the highest specific activity both in nature and under ionizing radiation, but with lower thermal stability above 60°C, than either BCAT from Escherichia coli (eBCAT) or from Thermus thermophilus (HB8BCAT).;  Several structures of BCAT from various species were previously determined, including human mitochondrial BCAT (hBCATm) (59) and human cytosolic BCAT (hBCATc) from human source (23), BCAT from E. coli (eBCAT) (42), HB8BCAT from Thermus thermophilus (PDB accession no. 1WRV [unpublished work]), BCAT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtBCAT) (6), and BCAT from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsBCAT) (6).;  From top to bottom, the BCATs were from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrBCAT), human cytosolic (hBCATc), human mitochondrial (hBCATm), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsBCAT), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtBCAT), Escherichia coli (eBCAT), and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (HB8BCAT).\n",

                                     Novel filamentous neutrophilic actinomycetes isolated from extreme biomes are a rich source of novel antibiotics (Bull and Goodfellow 2019), as exemplified by the discovery of novel polyketide antibiotics from the type strains of Micromonospora maris (Nouioui et al. 2018) and Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii (Busarakam et al. 2014) which were isolated from deep-sea sediment and hyper-arid Atacama Desert soil, respectively.;  Compared with their neutrophilic counterparts, acidophilic filamentous actinomycetes have rarely featured in bioprospecting campaigns even though they are common in acidic habitats and produce diverse specialized metabolites, notably novel antibiotics (Wang and Donk 2012).;  In general, acid-loving filamentous actinomycetes encompass acidotolerant (pH range 4.5–7.5., optimal growth around pH 5.5) and obligate acidophiles (pH range 3.5–6.5, optimal growth around pH 4.5 (Williams et al. 1971), as represented by Streptomyces (Xu et al. 2006) and Actinospica species (Cavaletti et al. 2006; Golinska et al. 2015), respectively.;  The present study, a continuation of our earlier work on the diversity of filamentous actinomycetes from Indonesian extreme habitats, was designed to establish the taxonomic status of an Actinospica strain isolated from acidic hot spring sediment.;  The strain was isolated on acidified actinomycete isolation agar (HiMedia, Mumbai, India), pH 4.5, after 2 weeks at 37 °C following inoculation of the plates with particles of the dried sediment.; As with the phenotypic characteristics shown in Table ​Table33 good congruence was found between the growth and cultural features of the isolate and corresponding results from the previous studies cited previously thereby providing further evidence of the value of cultural properties in the systematics of filamentous actinomycetes (van der Aart et al. 2019).;  It is becoming increasingly apparent that taxonomically diverse actinomycetes, including novel taxa, are a feature of geographically diverse hot springs (Song et al. 2009; Habib et al. 2020).;  Improved procedures are needed to selectively isolate and characterize novel actinomycetes, including Actinospica strains, from hot springs for biotechnological and ecophysiological purposes.; Aerobic, Gram-stain positive, actinomycete which forms an extensively branched substrate mycelium, tufts of white aerial hyphae that differentiate into long straight to flexuous chains of cylindrical spores (0.8–0.9 × 0.4–0.5 µm) with slightly rugose ornamentation.\n",

                                                  Acidophilic and acidotolerant eukaryotic microorganisms are mostly composed by algae (diatoms and unicellular and filamentous algae), protozoa, fungi and fungi-like protists, and unsegmented pseudocoelomata animals such as Rotifera and micro-macroinvertebrates.; AMD is responsible for the disappearance of several species of algae and diatoms, such as the Cyclotella and Fragilaria genera [12], and for loss of diatomic diversity in impacted sites [13] dominated by typical species of acidic waters [14,15], for example Pinnularia acoricola and Eunotia exigua.;  At the community level, the highest metal concentrations (along with pH < 3 and high Eh potential) implicate the lowest diversity [16], while at the individual level changes in frustule morphology are observed [15,17]. With respect to filamentous green algae, acidophilic species of the Mougeotia and Klebsormidium genus are abundant in AMD streams [18,19], as are other unicellular algae such as Chlamydomonas or Euglena, which may be very abundant in such environment, along with Protozoa and some multicellular protists.; Therefore, the main objective of this review is to summarize the scientific literature related to AMD production and its effects on eukaryotic organisms thriving in the water or sediments of streams and rivers, focusing on the following subjects: Acid Mine Drainage and the impact of AMD on algae, Protozoa, fungi and yeast as well as on micro- and macroinvertebrates.; Although AMD environments are not appetizing to many species, some genera of unicellular and filamentous green algae can adapt and survive; among these are species from the unicellular genera Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Cyanidium, Dunaliella, Euglena [73,74] and from the filamentous genera Klesormidium, Microspora, Mougeotia, Ulothrix, Stigeoclomium, Zygnema and Microthammion.; Cyanidium is a red algae genus, or rhodophite.;  Dunaliella, Chlamydomonas and Chlorella are unicellular green algae from the Chlorophyceae family.;  Chlamydomonas acidophila is the most abundant species in acid waters, showing a high tolerance to copper and other heavy metals [78,79] Euglena mutabilis is abundant in shallow waters and easily forms large tufts that can look like filamentous algae.;  All microalgae contribute to enhanced oxygen production (up to 200% saturation) and organic carbon, which reduces the oligotrophic conditions of AMD-polluted waters and increases the oxidative activity of aerobic chemoautolithotrophic bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria [80].; (A) Unicellular algae (Chlamydomonas acidophila), (B) Filamentous algae (Klebsormidium sp.), (C) Euglena mutabilis, (D) Protozoo Heliozoa, (E) Protozoo Ciliata, (F) Amoeba, (G) Rotífer.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                  However, highly acidic environments are usually inhabited by acidophilic and acidotolerant eukaryotic microorganisms such as algae, amoebas, ciliates, heliozoan and rotifers, not to mention filamentous fungi and yeasts.; Surprisingly, photosynthetic prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, have never been found in hot acidic aquatic systems [8]. Instead, these ecological niches are usually profusely colonized by species of the order Cyanidiales, red unicellular algae [8]. Thus, species from the genera Galdieria and Cyanidium have been isolated from hot sulfur springs, showing an optimal growth temperature of 45 °C and a maximum growth temperature of 57 °C [9,10]. These extreme hot springs are usually acidic (pH 0.05–4) and frequently characterized by high concentrations of metals such as cadmium, nickel, iron or arsenic, which are highly toxic to almost all known organisms.;  Aplanospores of Chlamydomonas nivalis are frequently found in high-altitude, persistent snowfields where they are photosynthetically active despite cold temperatures and high levels of ultraviolet radiation [11]. Distinct microbial communities composed of psychrophilic bacteria, microalgae and protozoa colonize and grow in melt pools on the ice surface, or in brine channels in the sub-ice platelet in the Arctic even during winter, at extremely low temperatures of −20 °C [12].;  Members of the phylum Chlorophyta such as Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, and Euglena, are the most frequent species followed by two filamentous algae belonging to the genera Klebsormidium and Zygnemopsis [24,25]. The most acidic part of the river, is inhabited by a eukaryotic community dominated by two species related to the genera Dunaliella and Cyanidium (Rhodophyta) well known for their high metal and acid tolerance [26]. Pennate diatoms are also present in the river forming large brown biofilms.; Molecular ecology techniques have identified algae closely related to those characterized phenotypically, emphasizing the high degree of eukaryotic diversity existing in the extreme conditions of Río Tinto [20,29]. Within the decomposers, fungi are very abundant and exhibit great diversity, including yeast and filamentous forms.; Light microscopy photographs of different eukaryotic species isolated from Río Tinto. (a) Filamentous green algae Klebsormidium sp.; (b) Diatoms; (c) Green algae Chlamydomonas spp.; (d) Heliozoa Actinophrys sp.;  The highest concentration of biomass of the ecosystem corresponds to photosynthetic algae, although other protists, yeast and filamentous fungi have been isolated along the river.\n",

grows at acidic pH at 45 °C.;  The protein HAP2/GCS1 (here called HAP2) is a gamete fusogen that is found in a wide range of eukaryotes including protists, algae, plants, insects, and hemichordates, and may be the “Eve” that enabled sex to evolve in early eukaryotes1.;  In contrast, all structures to date of the eukaryotic gamete fusogen HAP2, whether from the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamy) or the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, are of the trimeric, postfusion conformation4–7.;  Mechanisms that block premature triggering of trimerization may differ for viral class II fusion proteins and HAP2, since HAP2 may be stored intracellularly prior to gamete fusion, or in the case of algae or plants, hidden by the cell wall, digestion of which is required for gamete fusion10.;  Thus far, our best structural knowledge on HAP2 is from red and green algae and flowering plants, all of which have cell walls.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Cyanidiales are unicellular extremophilic red algae that inhabit acidic and high temperature sites around hot springs and have also adapted to life in endolithic and interlithic habitats.; The endolithic environment affords microorganisms protection from desiccation, rapid temperature variation, and UV radiation flux [1-3]. This microhabitat may, however, be extremely challenging, in particular for photosynthetic organisms because of limiting light (e.g., 1% of daylight) and nutrient conditions [1]. The Cyanidiales are unicellular red algae that thrive in endolithic habitats (see Fig. 1A, 1B) [1,4].;  The rbcL phylogeny is similar to a 3-gene tree found in our previous study [6]. The ML-all tree shows strong support for the monophyly of the Cyanidiales, with these taxa forming a sister group to the rest of the red algae (ML-all bootstrap = 95%, ML-1 + 2nd = 95%, ML-protein = 92%, and BPP = 1.0, Fig. ​Fig.2).2).; The Cyanidiales provide an untapped resource for understanding adaptations at the genomic level to life in extreme environments with one complete genome sequence already available (Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D) [15,17] and another that is nearly finished (Galdieria sulphuraria 074G) [18]. The Cyanidiales are unique in their ability as eukaryotes to thrive under extreme conditions at hot springs (temperatures between 50° – 55°C, pH between 0.5 – 3.0) [5-8,19]. These single-celled, photosynthetic red algae also have the ability to grow under low light conditions in endolithic habitats (see Fig. ​Fig.1)1) [1,4,6]. It is rare for eukaryotes to live beneath the rock surface, although endolithic prokaryotic communities have often been found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts, hot spring, and arctic regions) [3,4]. Endolithic Cyanidiales were first reported from Pisciarelli and La Solfatara near Naples, Italy [1]. These authors assumed, based on gross morphology (i.e., cell size from SEM images, see Fig. ​Fig.33 in Gross et al. [1]) that the endolithic Cyandiales were species of Cyanidium and Galdieria.;  Gross et al. [1] provided preliminary support for this colonization method based on their finding that after the application of an artificial silica layer on Galdieria cells, these algae maintain a dark-green color for 4 weeks, even when the silica layer becomes 1 mm thick [1]. In contrast, the PBen population was likely colonized by inoculation of 2 – 3 founder cells.;  These results are intriguing because they hint at the existence (present or in the recent past) of sexual reproduction in the Cyanidiales, a process that has never been observed in these algae either in culture or in the wild.;  B. For the rbcL gene, we included 24 representatives of the Cyanidiales that consist of 9 new sequences from Larderello (Tuscany), representing 90 individuals and 15 sequences from a previous study [6]. We used non-Cyanidiales red algae as the outgroup in this analysis.\n",

                 Moreover, intracellular secondary carotenoids were responsible for a reduction of blue-green light absorbed by chloroplasts by about 50%. These results revealed the high capacity of cysts to reduce the impact of harmful UV and high visible irradiation to the chloroplast and nucleus when exposed at alpine snow surfaces during melting.;  Specimens were collected in several alpine sites of Europe and North America, where cyst stages were responsible for orange blooms during summer.; Life at high alpine sites requires adaptation to extreme abiotic factors like temperature, visible and UV radiation and to their significant diurnal variations.; High levels of short wavelength irradiation are typical for alpine environments.\n",

                                                         We provide here, for the first time, insights into the initial infection stages of a large spindle-shaped archaeal virus and explore the following life cycle events.;  This work describes the first example of an archaeal virus employing three distinct association modes.;  However, we have only a rudimentary understanding of archaeal virus-host interactions.;  Of the about 100 isolated archaeal viruses, more than 30% infect hyperthermophilic Sulfolobales hosts (5,–7).;  To date, SIRV2 remains the most well characterized archaeal virus, and very little is known about the initial entry processes and later egress mechanisms of other archaeal viruses (9,–11).;  SMV1 and SIRV2 are the only two hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses for which the adsorption rate is known.;  The only other group of archaeal viruses for which adsorption rates have been studied are the viruses of halophilic Archaea, which often bind to their hosts extremely slowly; e.g., 30% adsorption over 3 h is observed for His1 (25, 26).; Very little is known about the initial infection stages of archaeal viruses, whereas studies of viruses infecting the other domains of life have revealed three common entry mechanisms: penetration, membrane fusion, and endocytosis (27).;  The ability of SMV1 and ATV to undergo major extracellular morphological development is a unique feature of these two archaeal viruses, not observed elsewhere in the virosphere.; Our study provides valuable insight into the initial infection stages of one of the large spindle-shaped archaeal viruses, SMV1.;  The work presented here provides a good basis for future studies into the viral traits of the large spindle-shaped archaeal viruses.\n",

Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) is an important fish throughout the world, especially in East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Japan.; Scomber japonicus (Pacific chub mackerel) is a mid-sized near-coastal fish species found at depths of 0 to 300 m in temperate regions in nearby seas of the northwest Indian and Pacific oceans (Bashir et al., 2018a).;  The aim of the current study was to investigate the in vivo antioxidant activities of muscle protein hydrolysates of Pacific chub mackerel, prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis.\n",

available proteomes of dsDNA viruses.; DNA replication systems in dsDNA viruses are even more diverse than those of their cellular hosts.;  First, dsDNA viruses differ according to the sets of DNA replication proteins encoded in their genomes.;  Second, compared to cellular organisms, dsDNA viruses employ a larger number of evolutionary solutions for at least some of the DNA replication steps.;  Are there novel assortments of DNA replication proteins in new viruses identified by genomics and metagenomics studies? Are there viruses that use yet unseen replication strategies? Can we make inferences extending across dsDNA viruses in the three domains of life? Here, we set out to address these questions by performing a global computational analysis of DNA replication proteins encoded by all sequenced bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic dsDNA viruses.; Genomes and proteomes of double-stranded DNA viruses were obtained from NCBI: ‘http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239&sort=taxonomy’. All the genomes of dsDNA viruses were subjected to six-frame translation and all previously unassigned open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 60 residues were retained for further analysis.; Replication proteins of dsDNA viruses were identified based on their similarity to characterized DNA replication proteins.;  To reduce the bias in database coverage of viral genomes, dsDNA viruses with highly similar genomes were filtered out, retaining a single representative member per virus group (see Materials and Methods).;  The length of the bar is proportional to the number of protein family members found in the representative set of dsDNA viruses.;  Replicative helicases in dsDNA viruses show a significantly higher diversity.; Diversity of replicative helicases domain organizations in dsDNA viruses.; Although SF1 helicases are abundant in viruses of the proposed order Megavirales (35), our data show that dsDNA viruses rarely (in 7% of the cases) use helicases of this type for genome replication (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  In dsDNA viruses we detected both types of primases and they were frequently fused with a replicative helicase or encoded next to it, as detailed above.;  We found that in dsDNA viruses SSBs based on the OB-fold are also most common, and the majority of them can be unambiguously linked to one of the groups represented by crystal structures of E. coli SSB (44), phage T7 protein gp2.5 (45), phage T4 protein gp32 (46), herpesvirus ICP8 (47) or archaeo-eukaryotic Replication Protein A (RPA) (48).;  Most often dsDNA viruses have E. coli SSB homologs that appear to be confined to bacteriophages (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  Since we did not find close Dna2 homologs in dsDNA viruses, we did not assign viral proteins of PD-(D/E)XK family to the list of putative primer removal proteins.;  We found that DNA ligases in dsDNA viruses are infrequent and that they are usually encoded in large genomes.;  Remarkably, Pandoraviruses, despite having the largest genomes among presently known dsDNA viruses, lack their own DNA ligase.;  DNA topoisomerases turned out to be among the least common DNA replication proteins in dsDNA viruses (Figure ​(Figure3).3).; Replication proteins arranged by their overall observed frequencies (%) in genomes of dsDNA viruses.; Replication protein complements identified across all groups of dsDNA viruses, provide a comprehensive picture of the distribution and frequency of different groups of replication proteins in the available viral genomes.;  We divided dsDNA viruses into three genome size groups (<40 kbp, 40–140 kbp and >140 kbp) in line with our previous finding (19) that the composition of DNA replicases is genome size-dependent.;  It turned out that as the genome size increases dsDNA viruses tend to code their own replication proteins more often (Figure ​(Figure5).5).; Relationship between the observed frequencies of viral DNA replication proteins and the genome size of dsDNA viruses.;  These observations suggest that the actions of DNA ligases and topoisomerases in dsDNA viruses might be closely coordinated.;  We found that B-family DNA polymerases and AEP primases, which are specific to replication machineries of archaea and eukaryotes, are conserved in dsDNA viruses from all three domains of life.;  If we consider the latter proteins at the family level, it appears that dsDNA viruses are just a reflection of their hosts, i.e., PCNA and RFC are identified in archaeal and eukaryotic viruses, whereas PolIIIβ and subunits of γ/τ-complex are only observed in bacteriophages.;  It has been demonstrated that bacterial members of the Caudovirales are evolutionarily related to tailed dsDNA viruses infecting archaea (31) and to eukaryotic members of the order Herpesvirales (73).; These and other patterns identified in our study reveal the fundamental logic of viral DNA replication that seems to be applicable to dsDNA viruses infecting hosts in all domains of life.\n",

“extreme” by human beings.;  Drought-tolerant and phosphorus-solubilizing extremophiles are suitable bio-inoculants and utilizing them for agriculture in desert landscapes might help in achieving global food security for the overgrowing human population (Verma et al., 2017).;  Certain extremophiles like Halobacterium and Rubrobacter produce bacterioruberin, an extremolyte, which helps in repairing damaged DNA caused by ionizing UV radiation and by extension, prevents human skin cancer (Raddadi et al., 2015; Sayed et al., 2019).;  Antimicrobial peptides such as halocins (that usually have specific ranges of activity) are effective at killing archaeal cells but don't harm microorganisms pathogenic to humans (Coker, 2016).;  Diketopiperazines (obtained from halophiles like Naloterrigena hispanica and Natronococcus occultus) function as antimicrobials, antifungals, antivirals, and antitumors as well as affect blood clotting in humans (Kaur et al., 2019).; Carotenoids, mainly β-carotene and astaxanthin, play a crucial role in the color of the retinal macula (yellow) and this color helps offer protection from the sun (by acting as a sunblock) to some parts of the retina so, carotenoids help in maintaining healthy vision in humans (Inoue et al., 2017).;  They can protect the skin against aging (with their antioxidative activity, etc.), microbes and absorb UV radiation while also having a less negative impact on marine life (bioaccumulation and hormonal changes in fishes, production of hydrogen peroxide, and bleaching of corals), inducing little to no side effects in humans (allergic reactions, phototoxicity, endocrine disorders) and being more eco-friendly (Geraldes and Pinto, 2021; Singh et al., 2021; Corinaldesi et al., 2017).;  Many industrial processes result in the contamination of the environment by heavy metals and radioactive pollutants which can be very harmful to humans and the ecosystem (Krzmarzick et al., 2018).\n",

G-quadruplex structures are intensively studied mainly in the context of human diseases, pathogens, or extremophile organisms; nonetheless, the knowledge about their occurrence and putative role in plants is still limited.;  It is worth noting that the mean and median lengths of introns are only 168 bp, or 100 bp, respectively, in Arabidopsis thaliana (for comparison, in maize, the mean intron length is 516 bp and the median is 146 bp; and in humans, the mean intron length is 3356 bp and the median is 1023 bp) [28]. With such small intron sizes in Arabidopsis thaliana, PQS (usually 25 bp long) would span a substantial part of them, and maybe this is one of the reasons why they are depleted there—to avoid potential problems with RNA splicing.\n",

microbiome profile of intact cells by propidium monoazide-based amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing, supplemented with an extensive cultivation effort.;  With a combination of different methods, including large-scale cultivation and propidium monoazide [11] (PMA) amplicon/shotgun metagenome sequencing from 13 selected sites at five sampling locations (sulfidic springs, hypersaline environments, two acidic aquatic environments, permafrost settings), we characterized the bacterial and archaeal communities with respect to taxonomic composition and functional capabilities.; The most abundant enzymes/functions detected in the shotgun metagenome dataset were (i) an integrase (involved in phage integration and excision), (ii) glycosyltransferase (biosynthesis of galactoglacans and related lipopolysaccharides), (iii) cation efflux system protein CusA (cobalt zinc cadmium resistance), (iv) long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase (fatty acid degradation regulons) and (v) decarboxylase (serine glyoxylate cycle) (additional information is given in Fig. ​Fig.33 and Additional file 2: Supplementary Table 9).\\n; The metagenome-derived microbial functions of the three environments showed differences in the levels of certain metabolic pathways and functions.;  AB, LW, SD, AM, EM, AE, MB, AR and CME performed microbiome/metagenome analyses and FISH.\n",

genome-resolved metagenomic approach to recover eight medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that likely represent a new order (“Candidatus Sysuiplasmatales”) in the class Thermoplasmata from mine tailings and acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments sampled from two copper mines in South China. 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed a narrow habitat range for these uncultured archaea limited to AMD and hot spring-related environments.;  Here, we report discovery and genomic characterization of a novel order (“Candidatus Sysuiplasmatales”) in the class Thermoplasmata based on eight metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) retrieved from acidic mine tailings and AMD sediments collected from two mine sites in South China.;  Metagenomic assembly and binning recovered eight unique Thermoplasmata genomes (metagenome-assembled genomes [MAGs]).; Genomic information of the Thermoplasmata novel-order MAGs retrieved from metagenomes\n",

                                                   The in vivo bioactivities of MMPH were investigated in alcoholic fatty liver mice (C57BL/6).;  Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were comparable in test and control mice, whereas serum triglyceride and lipid peroxidation levels significantly (p < 0.05; p < 0.001) decreased after administration of MMPH (100–500 mg kg−1), especially at a concentration of 100 mg kg−1.; Experimental animals (6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice) were purchased from SamTaco BioKorea (Osan, Rep. of Korea).;  The relative weights of liver and epididymal white adipose tissue in mice administered the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet for 6 weeks did not change with different MMPH concentrations.;  In contrast, despite the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet, serum ALT and AST activities were within the normal range for mice (ALT: 17-77 U L−1, AST: 54-298 U L−1) and results were similar to those of a previous study (Fengler et al., 2016).; The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidative potential of the S. japonicus protein hydrolysates fed to mice with alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n",

The 2020 ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover includes within its payload three IR spectrometers in the form of ISEM (Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars), MicrOmega, and Ma-MISS (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies).;  The results of this research highlight that sulfates on Mars are a mixed blessing, acting as an effective host for organic matter preservation but also a material that masks the presence of organic functional groups when analyzed with spectroscopic tools similar to those due to fly on the 2020 ExoMars rover.;  Sulfates have been mapped by the ESA Mars Express OMEGA instrument (Arvidson et al.,\\n2005; Bibring et al.,\\n2005; Gendrin et al.,\\n2005) and the Compact Reconnaissance Imagine Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) (Pelkey et al.,\\n2007; Wiseman et al.,\\n2010), and detected by the NASA rovers (Squyres et al.,\\n2004; Gellert et al.,\\n2006; Morris et al.,\\n2006; Ehlmann and Edwards, 2014; McAdam et al.,\\n2014).;  For the upcoming ExoMars rover, a similar process will be achieved through the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument (Goesmann et al.,\\n2017).; The results of this work are very timely and appropriate given that the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover includes within its payload three IR spectrometers in the form of ISEM (Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars), MicrOmega, and Ma-MISS (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies).;  ISEM is a pencil-beam spectrometer designed to study the mineralogical composition of the martian surface in the vicinity of the rover over the NIR spectral range between 1.15 and 3.3 μm (Korablev et al.,\\n2017).;  MicrOmega is a Vis-NIR hyperspectral microscope located within the rover's analytical laboratory drawer.\n",

high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that likely represent a new order (“Candidatus Sysuiplasmatales”) in the class Thermoplasmata from mine tailings and acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments sampled from two copper mines in South China. 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed a narrow habitat range for these uncultured archaea limited to AMD and hot spring-related environments.;  However, our knowledge of archaeal biology and evolution is still limited, since the majority of the archaeal diversity is uncultured.;  However, the majority of the archaeal diversity remains uncultured, limiting our understanding of their metabolic capacities and evolutionary history (7,–9).;  New cultivation-independent genomic approaches, especially metagenomics and single-cell genomics, have enabled reconstruction of nearly complete or even closed genomes for uncultured archaea directly from the environment (10).;  Subsequent analyses of the metabolic capabilities, origin, and evolutionary history of these uncultured microorganisms on the basis of the retrieved genomes have significantly advanced our understanding of archaeal biology (8).;  Reconstruction of metabolic pathways resolved the physiology and revealed potential ecological roles of these uncultured archaea, and ancestral state reconstruction revealed evolutionary paths leading to extant divergent Thermoplasmata lineages, including “Ca.;  Such capacities have also been found in uncultured archaea affiliated with Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota populating acid mine environments (2).\n",

                                       We utilized a genome-resolved metagenomic approach to recover eight medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that likely represent a new order (“Candidatus Sysuiplasmatales”) in the class Thermoplasmata from mine tailings and acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments sampled from two copper mines in South China. 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed a narrow habitat range for these uncultured archaea limited to AMD and hot spring-related environments.;  New cultivation-independent genomic approaches, especially metagenomics and single-cell genomics, have enabled reconstruction of nearly complete or even closed genomes for uncultured archaea directly from the environment (10).;  Reconstruction of metabolic pathways resolved the physiology and revealed potential ecological roles of these uncultured archaea, and ancestral state reconstruction revealed evolutionary paths leading to extant divergent Thermoplasmata lineages,

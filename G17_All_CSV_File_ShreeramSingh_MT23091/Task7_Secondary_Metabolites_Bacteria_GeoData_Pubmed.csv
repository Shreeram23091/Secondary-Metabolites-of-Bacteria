Southern Caliphornia,NA,"This study explores the bacterial and chemical composition of 32 ascidians, mainly from the didemnid family, across various geographical regions. It reveals a high diversity of ascidian microbiomes, independent of location or latitude, and stability over time within certain species. Both microbiomes and metabolomes exhibit species-specific and location-specific components. Location-specific bacteria are widespread strains, while location-specific metabolites are primarily lipids, possibly influenced by water temperature. Species-specific bacteria, often major secondary metabolite producers, and chemicals are dominated by secondary metabolites, indicating deliberate selection for these associations across different ascidian species. This suggests a strong evolutionary advantage and the independent evolution of secondary metabolite-based symbioses. The study sets the stage for further research connecting specific secondary metabolites with their producing bacteria, offering new insights into biological and biotechnological applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25171330/, 10.1038/ismej.2014.152,2014
"Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America",NA,"In assessing water ecosystem health, we studied short-term (2 days) variations in bacterial community and secondary metabolites during a cyanobacterial bloom in a tropical reservoir. Planktothricoides spp., Synechococcus, Pseudanabaena, Prochlorothrix, and Limnothrix dominated the water, with spatial variations being more significant than temporal ones. The bacterial community, mainly composed of Proteobacteria (β-proteobateria), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, remained consistent across cyanobacterial species and geographic regions. Statistical analyses revealed positive associations between cyanobacterial groups and off-flavor compounds like 2-methylisoborneol and β-ionone, indicating a cyanobacterial origin. Our findings underscore the utility of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for algal bloom monitoring and water-resource management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28345890/,10.1021/acs.est.6b05767,2017
"United State, philippines, Brazil",NA,"This study investigates shipworms and their symbiotic bacteria, crucial for wood recycling in marine environments. Shipworms were collected from diverse locations, and symbiotic bacteria from their gills were cultivated for analysis. Through metagenomic sequencing, the study confirms that cultivated symbionts represent major bacterial species and strains within shipworm gills, with consistent distribution patterns across host species. Remarkably, these symbiotic bacteria harbor diverse gene cluster families for biosynthesizing bioactive secondary metabolites, with most pathways being previously undescribed. About 150 out of approximately 200 total biosynthetic gene clusters identified in gill metagenomes are represented within the cultivated symbiont collection. This suggests shipworm symbionts are a rich source for discovering new biosynthetic pathways. The research highlights the symbiotic bacteria's critical role in shipworm nutrition and lifestyle, as well as their potential to produce novel bioactive compounds with pharmaceutical applications. By cultivating and genetically manipulating these symbionts, the study offers insights into how secondary metabolism influences microbial symbiosis.

Europe,NA,"Aflatoxins (AFs) are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus section Flavi, particularly in maize, favored by hot climate conditions. In 2015, France experienced exceptionally hot and dry weather, leading to AF contamination in maize. A survey found AF contamination in 6% of maize field samples and 15% of maize silo samples. To understand contamination origins, mycoflora in contaminated and non-contaminated samples from similar geographic and climatic conditions were characterized, with a focus on Aspergillus section Flavi. 67 strains of Aspergillus section Flavi were isolated, present in all AF+ samples and nearly 40% of AF- samples, indicating potent toxin producers in French fields. A. flavus was the most common species (69% of strains), with A. parasiticus also frequent (28% of strains), mostly in AF+ samples, consistent with the presence of AFG in those samples. This study underscores the prevalence of aflatoxigenic fungi in French maize fields and highlights the risk of AF contamination in regions experiencing global warming-induced climate changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30544593/,10.3390/toxins10120525,2018

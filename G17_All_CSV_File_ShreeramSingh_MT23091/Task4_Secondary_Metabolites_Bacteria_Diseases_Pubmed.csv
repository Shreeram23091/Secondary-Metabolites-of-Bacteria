Antarctic sub-sea,D007246,27128927,4882557," Antarctic sub-sea sediments were collected from the Ross Sea, and used to isolate 25 microorganisms, which were phylogenetically affiliated to three bacterial genera (Psychrobacter, Arthrobacter, and Pseudomonas) via sequencing and analysis of 16S rRNA genes.;  Several studies have shown that Antarctic bacteria harvested from Antarctic corals and sponges are a promising source of new antimicrobial compounds [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Specifically, several Antarctic strains belonging to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter, were able to inhibit the growth of several strains belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) [11,14]. Further studies demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity relies (at least in part) on the production of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) [12,13,15]. The Bcc consists of at least 20 closely related species inhabiting different ecological niches such as water, soil, plants rizosphere, and plants and animals [16,17,18]. Bcc are also opportunistic human pathogens that cause lung infections in immune-compromised individuals, including cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [19]. In one-third of infected individuals, it causes the “cepacia syndrome”—a form of septic shock, which involves the lungs essentially shutting down, resulting in fatality [20,21,22]. Bcc bacteria have proven to be very resilient and incredibly difficult to combat as they are resistant to almost all known antimicrobial agents and can survive under the most extreme conditions [23]. In this publication, we report a complete biodiscovery pipeline aiming at the identification of novel anti-Bcc compounds, starting from the isolation of bacteria from Antarctic sub-sea sediments."

CHA0 toxicity,D064420,17088380,1636139," By analyzing the responses of protists to bacterial supernatants obtained from different isogenic mutants whose production of one or more exometabolites was affected and also to culture extracts with antibiotic enrichment, we observed different contributions of the phenolic antifungal compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and the extracellular protease AprA to CHA0 toxicity for protists and to the encystation-reactivation cycle.;  Nevertheless, DAPG and HCN together appeared to contribute to CHA0 toxicity for this ciliate (Table ​(Table22)."

Heterorhabditis nematodes,D009349,28246174,5399116,"Members of the gammaproteobacterial Photorhabdus genus share mutualistic relationships with Heterorhabditis nematodes, and the pairs infect a wide swath of insect larvae.;  Consistent with this notion, we found that the dual insect-human pathogen P. asymbiotica, which also shares a mutualistic relationship with Heterorhabditis nematodes (34), produced stilbene 1 as expected, but stilbene epoxide 2 was not detected under identical HMM-based cultivation conditions (supplemental Fig.;  Heterorhabditis nematodes consume Photorhabdus biomass during a successful insect infection, and the bacterial stilbenes contribute to the food signal for recovery.;  Given that we were also not able to observe stilbene epoxide production in the closely related dual insect-human pathogen P. asymbiotica, which also shares a mutualistic relationship with Heterorhabditis nematodes (34), epoxide formation is likely more functionally relevant during insect pathogenesis and bacterial host detoxification."

Klebsiella,D007710,24069601,3771249," The gammaproteobacterial family Enterobacteriaceae (genera Gibbsiella, Enterobacter, Raoultella, and Klebsiella) was the best represented.;  In particular, DGGE analysis, in accordance with culturing, indicated that Enterobacter (bands 29, 32, 33, 46) was detected in all five individuals tested, whereas Klebsiella (25–28, 42–45) and Raoultella (47–51) were found only in some individuals (3 and 1 out of 5 individuals, resp.).;  However, no library clones related to the genus Klebsiella were detected, maybe due to differences in PCR amplificability of DNA extracted from the two guts and/or to the different amount of template DNA in PCR reactions due to the different sizes of adult guts.;  Similar to microbial gut investigation, the DGGE patterns indicated that the occurrence of diverse microbial genera (Enterobacter, Raoultella, Klebsiella, and Buttiauxella) and unclassified bacteria varied among the samples.;  In particular, the recurrent detection of the diazotrophs Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Raoultella sp., Rahnella sp., and S. maltophilia suggests that their contribution to beetle nitrogen requirements may be noteworthy [38], as observed in other insect orders [39]. In addition, considering that no obligate anaerobic bacteria were identified, facultative anaerobic bacteria may work as oxygen scavengers and could have a significant role in creating the microsite anaerobic conditions necessary to allow nitrogen fixation [34]. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae are also known to be involved in pheromone production; for example, common gut isolates in locusts, E. cloacae, K. pneumonia, and P. agglomerans, are responsible for the production of components of a locust cohesion pheromone [40]."

NPS,D009261,22140558,3226686," Previous phylogenetic analyses of fungal NRPSs and PKSs have suggested that a few of these genes were acquired by fungi via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria, including a hybrid NPS/PKS found in Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota).;  Here, we identify this hybrid gene in fungi representing two additional classes of Ascomycota (Aspergillus spp., Microsporum canis, Arthroderma spp., and Trichophyton spp., Eurotiomycetes; Chaetomium spp. and Metarhizium spp., Sordariomycetes) and use phylogenetic analyses of the most highly conserved domains from NRPSs (adenylation (A) domain) and PKSs (ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain) to examine the hypothesis that the hybrid NPS7/PKS24 was acquired by fungi from bacteria via HGT relatively early in the evolution of the Pezizomycotina.;  Our exploratory BLAST analyses revealed that twelve additional species within the Pezizomycotina representing two additional classes contain a homolog to the Co. heterostrophus hybrid NPS7/PKS24.;  However, the phylogenetic relationships, frequency among related taxa, and evolutionary origins of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene in these fungi are not known.; The goal of this study was to evaluate the evolutionary history of the Co. heterostrophus hybrid NPS7/PKS24, and putative homologs in other fungal taxa, in a comparative phylogenetic framework.;  Specifically, we use phylogenetic analyses of the most highly conserved domains from NRPSs (A domain) and PKSs (KS domain) to examine the hypothesis that the hybrid NPS7/PKS24 was acquired from bacteria via HGT relatively early in the evolution of the Pezizomycotina.; Eighteen new sequences were generated of the hybrid NPS/PKS from diverse species of Chaetomium and Aspergillus, including four isolates of Chaetomium globosum (NRRL 1870, 6296, 25144, and 29170), three currently recognized species of Chaetomium (Ch. rectum NRRL 25293, Ch. carpinum NRRL 1867, and Ch. olivaceum NRRL A-14615), three unidentified species of Chaetomium (NRRL A-2583, A-22357, and A-23409), three isolates of A. niger (NRRL 326, 328, and 334), and five isolates representing four species of Aspergillus (A. ficcum NRRL 364 and 372, A. foetidus NRRL 341, A. phoenicis NRRL 4851, and A. tubingensis NRRL 4875) (Table S1).; Phylogenetic analyses indicate a bacterial origin of the NRPS A domain in the hybrid NPS7/PKS24 homologs from fungi examined here.;  Fungal Clade 1, obtained from amplicons of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene in this study and the sequences from Trichophyton spp., Arthroderma spp., Metarhizium spp., and M. canis from GenBank, is subtended by Bacterial Grade 1, with which it forms a strongly supported, monophyletic group sister to Fungal Clade 2.; Phylogenetic analyses also suggest a bacterial origin of the PKS KS domain in the hybrid NPS7/PKS24 homologs (Fig. 3).;  Fungal Clade 1, obtained from amplicons of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene in this study (Table S1) and the sequences from Co. heterostrophus, M. canis, Trichophyton spp., Arthroderma spp., and Metarhizium spp. from GenBank, is distantly related to non-hybrid fungal KS domain sequences from fungi (Fungal Clade 3).;  Taken together, results of this study provide perhaps the most convincing evidence to date for HGT from bacteria to fungi of a hybrid NPS/PKS gene.;  These new findings demonstrate that the occurrence of the hybrid homologs of NPS7/PKS24 within the filamentous Ascomycota is much more widespread than was previously known and suggest an acquisition event early in the evolution of the Pezizomycotina before the radiation of the Leotiomyceta.; Two additional lines of evidence further support the hypothesis of a non-fungal origin of the hybrid NPS7/PKS24.;  First, the NPS/PKS hybrid gene in Co. heterostrophus (7.6 kb), Aspergillus niger (5.6 kb), Trichophyton spp. and Microsporum canis (7.4 kb), do not contain introns.;  This contrasts with many other NPS and PKS genes in the Pezizomycotina and has been used previously to argue for a bacterial origin of 6-MSAS type PKS genes (see Schmitt and Lumbsch 2009).;  Interestingly, the NPS/PKS hybrid gene in Chaetomium globosum (7.4 kb) contains six introns of unknown provenance.; Second, the common organization of hybrid NPS and PKS genes in most fungi studied to date is in the opposite orientation: PKS precedes NPS, as in Magnaporthe grisea ACE 1, rather than NPS preceding PKS.;  The orientation of the hybrid NPS/PKS we examined is known mainly from bacterial genomes and putative representatives from Aspergillus spp.;  All other known hybrid genes from Dikarya and remaining fungal clades exhibit the PKS/NPS orientation [35], [36], [45].; Although independent acquisition of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene in three fungal classes (Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes) is possible, a single acquisition of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene early in the evolution of the filamentous Ascomycota, coupled with subsequent vertical descent, lineage-specific diversification, and loss in many lineages is more parsimonious.;  This is concordant with the hypothesized evolution of 6-MSAS type PKS genes from lichen-forming fungi proposed by Schmitt and Lumbsch (2009), and with the common observation that secondary metabolite genes are only maintained if they confer a selective advantage [14], [23], [46]. Moreover, the relationships within Fungal Clade 1 in Figs. 1 and ​and33 show no significant conflict in topology based upon the Kishino-Hasegawa, Winning-Sites, and Templeton tests (P = 0.1497, 0.1680, and 0.3449, respectively), revealing congruent phylogeny for each domain and suggesting that the hybrid NPS/PKS gene has evolved as a single unit since its initial fungal inheritance.;  Recent vertical descent of the NPS/PKS hybrid gene within genera (Fungal Clade 1 in Fig. 1 and ​and3)3) is strongly suggested by high support values for the Aspergillus and Chaetomium clades of both domains.;  Further screening of genomic data or PCR coupled with more sensitive methods such as cloning are needed to more precisely evaluate patterns of gene loss, and to verify the lack of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene in related taxa such as Aspergillus Section Flavi and close relatives of other fungi that possess this gene.;  The placement and support for the close evolutionary relationship of A. xylosoxidans and Fungal Clade 1 suggests that the putative bacterial donor of the fungal NPS/PKS hybrid gene may be an ancestor of A. xylosoxidans or a closely related species within the Burkholderiales.; We have provided support for HGT from bacteria to fungi of the A and KS domains of the hybrid NPS7/PKS24 in Co. heterostrophus and homologs identified in additional fungal taxa.;  By using constraint analyses we were able to show that a fungal origin of the hybrid NPS/PKS gene can be rejected by tests of topological hypotheses of constrained and unconstrained analyses.;  Future functional analyses of this hybrid NPS/PKS gene will elucidate the gene product, which is expected to be a partially reduced PK with a single amino acid decoration [24], and the roles that this secondary metabolite may play within the metabolome of these fungi.; Degenerate primers for PCR were designed in MEGA 4.0 [47] by translating nucleotide sequences of Cochliobolus heterostrophus NPS7/PKS24, Aspergillus niger {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CAK42046"",""term_id"":""134081790"",""term_text"":""CAK42046""}}CAK42046 , and Chaetomium globosum {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""XM_001224326"",""term_id"":""116197029"",""term_text"":""XM_001224326""}}XM_001224326 (obtained from GenBank) to amino acids prior to alignment with Co. heterostrophus NRPS7/PKS24, A. niger unnamed protein product {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AM270324"",""term_id"":""134081767"",""term_text"":""AM270324""}}AM270324, and Ch. globosum hypothetical protein CHGG_05113.; Constraint analyses were used to test the null hypothesis that the phylogenetic histories of the A domain and the KS domain from the hybrid NPS/PKS gene was consistent with the assumption of fungal origin.;

;  This report focuses on a bacterium isolated from the ear of a feral hog from southwestern Oklahoma, USA.;  A new, natural-product-producing strain of Brevibacillus laterosporus was obtained from a feral hog originating in southwestern Oklahoma, USA.; Using an opportunistic sampling approach [17], the oral cavity, ear canal, and nasal cavity of a feral hog taken by a hunter in southwestern Oklahoma were swabbed for microbial inhabitants within 24 h of being bagged.; The mouth, nose, and ears of a feral hog, shot by a hunter (in compliance with state ordinances) in southwestern Oklahoma, were swabbed with sterile cotton swabs.;  Since our opportunistic sampling strategy does not involve the handling of live animals, only sampling carcasses, we have been assigned an internal case-tracking number (R11-021) by the University of Oklahoma IACUC.;  A State-of-Oklahoma-issued Scientific Collector Permit (permit #5250) was obtained for the purpose of sampling carcasses.;  The purity of gDNA was confirmed by spectrophotometery (Implen) and submitted to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation genomics core facility for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq using TruSeq LT 2×150 bp chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA).; Financial support for this project was provided in part by an award from the National Institutes of Health (5R21AI101487), a Challenge Grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research, University of Oklahoma, Norman Campus, and an award through the Shimadzu Equipment Grant Program."
PD,D010300,19806188,2751819,"Parkinson disease (PD) involves progressive neurodegeneration, including loss of dopamine (DA) neurons from the substantia nigra.;  Select genes associated with rare familial forms of PD function in cellular pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), involved in protein degradation.;  The misfolding and accumulation of proteins, such as α-synuclein, into inclusions termed Lewy Bodies represents a clinical hallmark of PD.;  Given the predominance of sporadic PD among patient populations, environmental toxins may induce the disease, although their nature is largely unknown.;  Thus, an unmet challenge surrounds the discovery of causal or contributory neurotoxic factors that could account for the prevalence of sporadic PD.;  Collectively, these data suggest the potential for exposures to the metabolites of specific common soil bacteria to possibly represent a contributory environmental component to PD.;  For example, PD is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting millions of individuals worldwide.;  Over the course of the past decade, human genetic discoveries have driven substantial mechanistic advances in our understanding of PD [1]. Nevertheless, an inescapable fact of PD epidemiology is that over 90% of cases are of sporadic origin.;  Twin studies indicate that environmental influences are critical to disease onset and appear pivotal to sporadic causality [2]. Thus, while genetic analyses have substantially advanced our mechanistic understanding of PD, it is apparent that investigation into purely genetic factors will not elucidate all or even most PD incidence.;  Therefore, our ability to successfully reduce the frequency of PD is dependent upon knowledge about factors that render certain populations at risk.; PD affects more than 1% of the population over age 65, increasing to 4–5% in people 85-years of age.;  In addition to aging, one of the few established epidemiological contributors to PD appears to be a rural lifestyle.;  Analyses of various factors has revealed that living in rural areas, drinking well water, farming, and exposure to pesticides or herbicides may all be risk factors for developing PD [3], [4]. Toxins that cause formation of excessive reactive oxygen species, like paraquat and rotenone, as well as MPTP, all induce Parkinsonian phenotypes in animals [5]. While use of pesticides has been suggested to be partially responsible for PD in rural areas, this does not sufficiently correlate to disease prevalence, as the odds ratio for farming itself cannot be accounted for by pesticide exposure alone [6], [7].;  Impairment of the UPS as a contributory factor to sporadic PD has been suggested by a variety of studies [9]. We therefore hypothesized that enhanced exposure to these bacteria may contribute to the onset or progression of PD.; When considering potential environmental sources of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative disorders, we were intrigued by reports that described DA neurodegeneration and PD-like symptoms following direct injection of proteasome inhibitors into rat brains [10], [11]. This prompted us to initially determine if exposure to proteasome inhibitors could cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans.; The unfolded protein response (UPR) is another common mechanism associated with cellular stress and PD [27]. We examined the possibility that the S. venezuelae factor up-regulated the UPR by exposing worms expressing an established UPR reporter, Phsp-4::GFP, to conditioned medium [28]. C. elegans HSP-4 is homologous to the mammalian ER chaperone, BiP, and its transcription is prominently induced in the worm intestine in response to ER stress.;  Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells can synthesize DA, and are commonly used as a cellular model of PD.; Onset and progression of PD appears to converge at the intersection between environmental influences, intrinsic DA metabolism, and accumulation of misfolded proteins to yield enhanced susceptibility to neurodegeneration over the course of time.;  Support for a “multiple hit” hypothesis for induction of neurodegeneration in PD has recently come from an elegant study indicating that increased cytosolic DA levels influence neurotoxicity through generation of oxidized metabolites that interact with α-synuclein, an effect that is blocked by calcium channel blockers [36]. We previously showed that overexpression of the C. elegans TH homolog, CAT-2, in nematode DA neurons also led to increased neurodegeneration, an effect that was blocked by 3-iodotyrosine treatment (13).; While non-pathogenic bacteria have not been previously implicated in PD-associated degeneration, an earlier report [43] demonstrated that mice injected with Nocardia asteroides, a human pathogen also of the order Actinomycetales, developed PD-like symptoms and responded to levodopa treatment.;  The prevalence of PD argues against pathogenic bacterial infection as a major contributory element in disease etiology.;  Moreover, the progressive nature of PD is reflected in the moderate and age-associated gradated degeneration we observed in response to the Streptomyces neurotoxic metabolite in C. elegans and warrants further investigation in mammalian in vivo models.;  Importantly, without knowing the precise identity of the factor(s) produced by these bacteria, or the concentrations at which they are toxic to humans compared to those applied in this report, any correlations to PD pathogenesis are indirect and should be taken with caution, as this remains to be resolved through future studies.;  A rural lifestyle, drinking well water, farming, and exposure to pesticides or herbicides may all be risk factors for developing PD [3], [4]. Systematic evaluation of occupational, domestic, and recreational exposures to actinomycete-rich soil or adjacent well water sources may reveal unforeseen correlates to PD.; To construct Pdat-1::CFP::CL-1 transgenic worms, pPD133.48, a CFP containing plasmid (gift from Andy Fire) was used as a template to amplify CFP::CL-1 using a CFP specific forward primer and a reverse primer that incorporated the last few nucleotides of CFP and the entire CL-1 sequence [30] (sequences available upon request).;  The CFP::CL-1 fusion was cloned into a Gateway pDONR221 vector (Invitrogen) and then recombined into pDEST-DAT1 [13]. 10 µg each of Pdat-1::CFP::CL-1 plasmid DNA and an unc-119 rescuing vector (pDP#MM016B) [52] were co-introduced into unc-119 worms by biolistic bombardment using a Bio-Rad Biolistic PDS-1000/He particle delivery system [53]. A rescued, stable (unc-119
+) line expressing CFP in DA neurons was integrated using UV-irradiation in a Spectroline UV crosslinker at 254 nm at 200 mJ/cm3."

RHL,C537062,27626430,5039536," In this study, a culture-dependent approach was applied to three types of sediments: mangrove mud (MN), microbial mat (MM), and barren soil (BS), collected from Rabigh harbor lagoon (RHL) and Al-Kharrar lagoon (AKL).;  Thus, microorganisms that inhabit unexplored unique soil compositions, such as in the Rabigh harbor lagoon (RHL) and Al-Kharrar lagoon (AKL) of the highly saline and hot Red Sea, represent untapped reservoirs of organisms that potentially produce novel bioactive compounds.;  RHL and AKL are located on the eastern coast of the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia.;  Additionally, RHL is considered a contaminated site owing to it being used as a harbor and being located near Petro Rabigh (Refining and Petrochemical Company), whereas AKL is considered less contaminated because its coast is poorly inhabited and only minor fishing activity is present in the lagoon.; In this study, we sampled sediments from three Red Sea environments: mangrove mud (MN), microbial mat (MM), and soil (BS) collected from the RHL and AKL.;  The contrasting counts, for Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these different sediments types, may be due to the spore-producing Firmicutes ability to survive in more adverse oligotrophic environments such as in BS compared to MN [43]. Additionally, Proteobacteria has the known ability to utilize chemical elements in soil more than other microorganisms, which makes the nutrient rich MN sediment more favorable for this phylum [44,45]. Bacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum were isolated from BS at RHL, and from MN collected from RHL and AKL, while Bacteroidetes were only isolated from BS collected from both locations.;  Planctomycetes were cultured from various sites such as MM and BS at RHL, and MN at AKL.;  The Bacillus species, recognized as an important source of natural bioactive products [46], are commonly found in nutrient-poor soils [47].

Rickettsia,D012282,26866478,4750851,"Rickettsia species are strictly intracellular bacteria that have undergone a reductive genomic evolution.;  Despite their allopatric lifestyle, almost half of the 26 currently validated Rickettsia species have plasmids.; Plasmids were differentially present among Rickettsia species.;  We reconstructed pRICO, the last common ancestor of the current rickettsial plasmids. pRICO was vertically inherited mainly from Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes and diverged vertically into a single or multiple plasmid(s) in each species.; Rickettsial plasmids had a complex evolution, starting with a vertical inheritance followed by a reductive evolution associated with increased complexity via horizontal gene transfer as well as gene duplication and genesis.; Rickettsia species (Order Rickettsiales, Family Rickettsiaceae) are obligate intracellular α-proteobacteria associated with diverse eukaryotic hosts.;  The genus Rickettsia emerged approximately 150 million years ago after several transitions from a presumably free-living ancestor of Rickettsiales to an intracellular life and then to primarily infecting arthropod lineages approx. 525–425 million years ago [1, 2]. Rickettsiae can infect humans or animals, mostly through arthropod bites, and can cause a range of mild to fatal diseases such as epidemic typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.;  Twenty-six species currently have standing in the nomenclature, but many isolates await taxonomic classification [3]. Rickettsia species diverged into three phylogenetic groups: the spotted fever group (SFG) associated with ticks, fleas and mites and causing spotted fevers, the typhus group (TG) including R. prowazekii and R. typhii associated with body lice and rat fleas, respectively, and causing typhus, and the so-called ancestral group (AG) containing R. bellii and R. canadensis, associated with ticks [4,5]. However, recent studies have showed that other Rickettsia lineages exist, notably associated with protists, leeches or arthropods [1, 2].;  Consequences of this progressive genomic reduction included: i) an enrichment in A+T content, polyA/T homopolymers, conjugative clusters and mechanisms of adhesion to host and motility; ii) a high degree of inter-species genomic synteny; iii) an increased virulence; and iv) a variable distribution of plasmids [2, 6–11]. Although initially thought to be devoid of plasmids, such mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have now been identified in at least 11 Rickettsia species.; Rickettsial plasmids (RPs) were first detected in R. felis in which two isoforms of the putative conjugative pRf plasmid were identified [14]. Based on phylogenomic analysis, the genes in the R. felis pRf plasmid were suggested to have been acquired through a single horizontal gene transfer event in R. felis or in an ancestor before the divergence of the R. felis/ R. akari clade [14, 17]. Furthermore, on the basis of the presence of the pRf plasmid and one unpublished sequence of a putative plasmid in R. bellii OSU85-389, it was hypothesized that the primitive rickettsial ancestor harbored a plasmid system that was lost in certain lineages [23]. Moreover, Baldridge et al. [21, 22] suggested multiple possible origins of RPs as well as likely horizontal transfers from plasmids to chromosomes and vice versa using phylogenetic analyses of the parA, hsp1 and hsp2 genes.;  As recent studies have demonstrated that plasmids, not virus, are key vectors of genetic exchanges between bacterial chromosomes, even between distant phylogenetic groups [24, 25], we accepted the opportunity provided by the expanded number of publicly available genomes from arthropod-associated Rickettsia species to study the RPs by comparative genomic analysis and to reconstruct the evolutionary scenario of forces that shaped their structures and predicted functions.; Genomic sequences of plasmids and chromosomes (100% and 94% of which are both complete and circular, respectively) belonging to 26 species and 35 strains of Rickettsia and Orientia genera were downloaded from the NCBI ftp server (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/Genome/).;  To avoid potential biases across the originally published and unpublished data, that were generated by different gene identification and annotations, all genomes were subjected to CDSs (CoDing Sequences) predictions with the same AMIgene software [26] and automatic functional re-annotation against the RickBase [17] and non-redundant NR databases using pipRick (an in-house annotation pipeline written in Perl language) including the BLASTp algorithm [27]. The re-annotated plasmids were then manually curated and either complete (coverage > = 80% of the longest homolog), split (gene with at least two CDSs), fragment (coverage <80% of the longest homolog) or chimeric genes were distinguished [14, 17]. Functional classification of gene families (COG ID and Letters) was searched using COGnitor and COGsoft against COG database [28, 29]. Thus, a standardized database named RickettsiaDB was constructed for further investigations.; In order to examine evolutionary relationships between Rickettsia plasmids, proteins were subjected to a reciprocical best BLAST hit (BBH) algorithm with all-against-all search (coverage of the query length > = 60% and E-value < 10-5) using COGsoft software [28, 29]. Each putative orthologous groups of plasmidic rickettsial genes was named pRIGs, and then a manual curation was performed to detect false negatives.; Evolutionary relationships between rickettsial plasmids, Rickettsia and Orientia chromosomes as well as microbial and non-microbial genomes were, first, examined using BLASTp and tBLASTn algorithms (Cutoffs: aa sequence identity > = 25%, coverage query> = 60%, E-value<10-5), search against RickettsiaDB (excluding plasmid sequences), non-redundant NR and RefSeq_genomic databases to identify their corresponding best homologs.; The correlation between Rickettsia plasmids and chromosomes sizes was performed using the correlation coefficient R of Pearson and the coefficient of determination R². Statistical analyses were performed using the R Commander software package (http://r-forge.r-project.org).; A total of 20 plasmids occurred in 11 SFG Rickettsia species, represented by 13 strains collected from various geographical locations worldwide (Table 1).;  This may be explained by strain differences (i. e., plasmid loss in nature), as observed in R. africae [9] or their passage history in cell culture, as observed in R. felis [36] or other bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi [37]. Among the other 5 genera within the order Rickettsiales (Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia, Orientia, Wolbachia), all available genome sequences were devoid of plasmids [23]. RPs ranged in number and size per species from 1 to 4 plasmids and from 12 kb to 83 kb, respectively, and contained 15 to 85 genes (Table A in S1 File).; Phylogenetic trees of 12 pRIGs (4.4%), conserved in most plasmids, exhibited two phylogenetically-related clades, one including 5 to 20 RPs and the other made of 1 to 26 chromosomes from Rickettsia and/or Orientia (Figures A1 to A9 in S3 File).;  Moreover, the supertree constructed from 10 of the 12 pRIGs confirmed these two phylogenetically-related clades, one containing all the 20 RPs and the other all Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes (Fig 4).;  Phylogenetic analysis of a second set of 41 (15%) pRIGs showed the same two related clusters in each tree, one containing 1 to 11 RPs and the other 1 to 30 Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes (Figures A10 to A49 in S3 File).; Both “pRICO” and “cRICO” (i.e., the last common ancestor of the current Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes) may have been vertically inherited from a last common chromosomal ancestor, “RICO” (Figs ​(Figs44 and ​and5).5).;  Moreover, 8 (3%) pRIGs were also vertically transmitted to RPs but matched non-Rickettsia/Orientia species, suggesting that they might have been horizontally acquired by pRICO from unknown species (Figures A50 to A53 in S3 File).;  In contrast, the plasmids from either R. raoultii (pRra1/2/3), Rickettsia endosymbiont of I. scapularis (pReis1/3, except pReis1/2) or R. amblyomii (pRam18/23/32) strains were resolved into distinct phylogenetic groups with variable sequence conservation, although they lived in the same bacterial strain as well as the same host-species (Fig 4 and Figures BE to BG in S2 File).; The plasmidome exhibited 23 (8%) pRIGs resulting from evident horizontal gene exchanges (HGT1, plasmid-chromosome and/or plasmid-plasmid) within a given Rickettsia species, and/or between distinct Rickettsia species (Fig 5, Figures A37 and A54 to A74 in S3 File).;  These data suggest that both Rickettsia species may have had one (for R. prowazekii) or an additional (for R. raoultii) plasmid that was disrupted in the course of the reductive genomic evolution in the genus Rickettsia, with subsequent HGT1 integration of plasmidic genes in their chromosomes.; Thirty-four (12%) pRIGs exhibited evident horizontal gene transfers (HGT2, plasmid-genome) with known non-Rickettsia/Orientia species, mostly belonging to α/γ-proteobacteria lineages (Fig 5, Figure D in S2 File, Figures A75 to A111 in S3 File).;  Moreover, 55 (20%) pRIGs displayed putative horizontal gene exchanges (HGT2) of unknown origin, but matching homologs of non-Rickettsia/Orientia species, also mostly belonging to α/γ-proteobacteria lineages (Fig 5, Figure E in S2 File, Figures A39 to A44, A46, A47, A100 and A112 to A136 in S3 File).; Finally, five pRIGs (1.8%, originally present in 65 pRIGs inherited by VGT) and one pRIG (0,4%, originally present in the 34 pRIGs exchanged by HGT2) displayed evidence of additional gene transfers (HGT3, plasmid-genome) between Rickettsia and distant lineages including Cardinium endosymbiont of Encarsia pergandiella, Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus (Bacteroidetes) as well as bacterial endosymbionts of either Trichoplax adhaerens or Hydra magnipapillata (Bacteria) (Fig 5, Figure D in S2 File, Figures A10, A11, A55, A57, A58 and A101 in S3 File) [42–44].;  Overall, VGT and duplication forces drove pRIGs common to RPs and Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes which may increase the biological activities of some rickettsiae, whereas HGT forces enabled some RPs to acquire novel metabolic functions absent in Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes that may complete host-metabolic gaps and confer host-adaptive phenotypes to obligate intracellular lifestyle.; In poorly and uncharacterized categories, VGT, HGT and de novo gene genesis drove distinct proportions of pRIGs (7.6, 13.8 and 23.3%, resp.) which have known or unknown functions and/or poorly or uncharacterized COG assignments and that remain to be elucidated for the biology of Rickettsia species (see details in Table B in S1 File)."
Sphingopyxis genus,D056304,26847793,4741004," Genomic sequence analysis and proteome comparison re-assigned the TFA strain to the Sphingopyxis genus and the S. granuli species.; The Sphingopyxis genus was first described in 2001 as a group of strictly aerobic and chemo-organotrophic bacteria incapable of nitrate reduction [2]. Abundant partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence information can be found on public databases, which has been used for the ascription of bacterial isolates to the Sphingopyxis genus.;  Recently, four more strains have been sequenced and also ascribed to the Sphingopyxis genus.;  This study analyzes the assembled and annotated genomic sequence of strain TFA, which strongly supports its ascription to the Sphingopyxis genus, and provides in silico and experimental evidence of anaerobic growth using nitrate as an electron acceptor, which has not been previously described for members of this genus.;  Like other Sphingopyxis genus members, TFA shows genomic characteristics described for oligotrophic representatives and horizontal transfer seems to have played an important role in its genome organization.;  The absence of selenoproteins can be regarded as another feature of Sphingopyxis genus extended to all Sphingomonads with sequenced genomes.;  On the other hand, ascription of S. baekryungensis DSM 16222 to the Sphingopyxis genus is less obvious, since its position in the phylogenetic tree is in a different branch.;  Moreover, a dendrogram created by clustering pairwise amino acid average identity analysis (AAI) [24] also supports the phylogenetic relationship between TFA and Sphingopyxis genus representatives (Fig. 1b and Additional file 2).;  Taken together, all the data support the phylogenetic ascription of TFA to the Sphingopyxis genus and provides more evidence for the exclusion of S. baekryungensis DSM 16222 from this genus as recently proposed [1].;  Sphingopyxis genus members are under the blue line
; A low number of both prophages and CRISPR regions are features already defined for oligotrophic bacteria [4] that might also be considered as particularities of the Sphingopyxis genus members.; Anaerobic growth has not been described for any member of the Sphingopyxis genus before.; The data presented in this paper show that the Sphingopyxis genus is a compact group in which the affiliation of S. baekryungensis DSM 16222 should be revised.; The average amino acid identity (AAI) was calculated for a representative of each Sphingomonadaceae genus with a sequenced genome (completely assembly or not), except for the Sphingopyxis genus where all representatives were selected.;  TFA specific genes within the Sphingopyxis genus were extracted from the pan-core plot data with the pancoreplot_subsets program."
Tethya rubra Samaai,D008883,28346340,5408241," In this study, we investigated the bacterial communities associated with the sponge Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005.; Tethya species are known to produce bioactive secondary metabolites [15,16]. Two nucleosides, spongothymidine and spongosine, were isolated from the sister genus, Tectitethya crypta [17,18]. The synthetic analogue, Cytarabine is used as a chemotherapy drug in the treatment of leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma [19], while another, Vidarabine, is an antiviral compound [20]. Recently, the biosynthetic origin of spongosine and other structurally-related compounds was found to be a strain of Vibrio harveyi that was associated with T. crypta [21]. Bioactive compounds have also been isolated from fungi associated with Tethya species [22,23]. In this study we investigated the bacterial communities associated with Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005 [24], which is common at depths between 30 and 51 m on reefs in Algoa Bay, South Africa.;  In addition, we compared the chemical profiles of crude extracts prepared from the Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005 sponges.;  In addition, we report that the chemical profiles of crude extracts prepared from the Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005 sponges collected from different locations were distinct.;  All four sponge specimens were morphologically identified as Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005 through examination of gross morphology and spicule analyses (Figure 1c–e).; Morphological and molecular identification of Tethya rubra Samaai and Gibbons 2005 specimens collected from Algoa Bay.

ViI,D016538,25118075,4184006," We showed recently that the transducing bacteriophage ϕMAM1 is a ViI-like phage and a member of the new genus, ‘Viunalikevirus'. Here, we show that four additional ViI-like phages and three new environmentally isolated viunalikeviruses, all infecting plant and human pathogens, are very efficient generalised transducers capable of transducing chromosomal markers at frequencies of up to 10−4 transductants per plaque-forming unit.;  The first member of this proposed genus, Salmonella phage ViI, was isolated in the 1930s (Craigie and Yen, 1938) and multiple viunalikeviruses have been sequenced and characterised since 2010 (Pickard et al., 2010; Anany et al., 2011; Hooton et al., 2011; Kutter et al., 2011; Matilla and Salmond, 2012; Park et al., 2012; Adriaenssens et al., 2012a, 2012b; Hsu et al., 2013; Luna et al., 2013; Shahrbabak et al., 2013).; We recently isolated the ViI-like phage, ϕMAM1, that infects several environmental and clinical isolates belonging to Serratia and Kluyvera genera (Matilla and Salmond, 2012).;  These observations were consistent with a previous report, that the Salmonella phage ViI was also capable of transduction (Cerquetti and Hooke, 1993) and we have confirmed that phage ViI can transduce chromosomal markers and plasmids at frequencies of up to 4.6 × 10−5 transductants per plaque-forming unit (p.f.u.; Figure 1a; Supplementary Table 1).; Transduction capabilities of viunalikeviruses. (a) Transduction frequencies of LIMEstone1, LIMEstone2, ViI and CBA120 phages.;  Based on the high similarity between the terminases of ϕMAM1, ViI and those of other previously sequenced viunalikeviruses, we hypothesised that all of these ViI-like phages should be capable of transduction in their respective bacterial hosts.;  Although ToxIN aborts infection of various enterobacteria by diverse phages (Fineran et al., 2009b) it did not protect against infection by the tested viunalikeviruses, ϕMAM1, ViI, CBA120, LIMEstone1 or LIMEstone2 (not shown).;  Furthermore, another type III TA system, TenpIN, from the insect pathogen, Photorhabdus luminescens (Blower et al., 2012), failed to protect against any of the five ViI-like phages (not shown).;  From treated sewage effluent, we isolated three new bacteriophages infecting Dickeya solani, ϕXF1, ϕXF3 and ϕXF4, as defined initially by their very characteristic ViI-like morphology in electron microscopy (Figures 2a–c).; Although we did not have access to other ViI-like Salmonella phages SFP10 (Park et al., 2012), ϕSH19 (Hooton et al., 2011) and Marshall (Luna et al., 2013), Escherichia phage PhaxI (Shahrbabak et al., 2013), Shigella phage ϕSboM-AG3 (Anany et al., 2011) and Klebsiella phage 0507-KN2-1 (Hsu et al., 2013), our results allow us to predict that all of these phages will mediate generalised transduction.; Viunalikeviruses do not seem to be limited to the enterobacteria as bacteriophages showing ViI-like morphology have been isolated in Acinetobacter (Ackermann et al., 1994), Bordetella (Adriaenssens et al., 2012b) and Sinorhizobium (Werquin et al., 1988).;  Furthermore, another ViI-like morphotype phage (ϕM12 of Sinorhizobium meliloti) has also been shown to be an efficient transducer (Finan et al., 1984).;  Taken together, these results suggest that, even in the absence of strongly predictive comparative genomic detail, a characteristically discrete ViI-like morphology in electron microscopy may be sufficient to identify new phages as strong candidates for possession of generalised transduction capacity."

(B) Map of the DNA fragments cloned in pET22b that were used for expression of accB and/or accE in E. coli.; The sequence also revealed the presence of a small ORF, accE, whose start codon was only 17 bp downstream of the termination codon of accB.;  A 17-nucleotide (nt) inverted repeat which could function as a factor-independent bidirectional transcriptional terminator separates accE from three convergent ORFs with homology to putative proteins of M. tuberculosis of unknown function.; Overexpression of accB and accE in E. coli was attempted with strain RG8, a BL21(DE3) strain containing pTR88 (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1).; The genetic organization of accB and accE as members of the same transcription unit suggested that AccE could also be a functional component of the ACCase complex.;  To confirm this hypothesis, we first integrated pTR149 (see Materials and Methods; Fig. ​Fig.3B)3B) containing accBE and the native promoter into the φC31 attB site of T124 (the presence of accE in this construct would also cater for any polar effect on the expression of accE caused by disruption of the native copy of accB).;  Potential −10 and −35 regions for accBEp are underlined. (C) S1 nuclease mapping of the accB-accE intergenic region using a 563-nt probe.; To determine if accB and accE were cotranscribed, a 563-bp probe was generated by PCR that spanned the intergenic region.;  For this we used a 5′ oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence within the coding region of accB and a 3′ oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence within accE.;  The results clearly showed that accB and accE were part of the same transcript (Fig. ​(Fig.5C).5C).;  Expression of accB and accE in E. coli and subsequent in vitro reconstitution of enzyme activity in the presence of the biotinylated proteins AccA1 and AccA2 confirmed that AccB was the carboxyl transferase subunit of an ACCase."

blooms,D001816,23807545,3736421," Comparatively few research studies have considered how this information can be used to understand the broader ecological role of cyanotoxin(s), and the possible applications of this knowledge to the management of toxic blooms.;  This information may provide a fresh perspective on managing toxic blooms, including the need to use a “systems approach” to understand how physico-chemical conditions, as well biological stressors, interact to trigger toxin production. ; The cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are photosynthetic microorganisms commonly found in a diverse range of aquatic and terrestrial environments including Antarctic lakes, thermal springs, arid deserts, and tropical acidic soils [1,2]. Typically, however, it is the toxin-producing blooms of these species that are of greatest interest and concern to humans, especially where these appear in tropical, subtropical, and temperate fresh and marine waters used for recreational or drinking water purposes.; Whilst the molecular evidence strongly suggests that the evolution of genes for toxin production pre-dated the existence of metazoans, this does not eliminate all possibility for evolution of cyanotoxins as a grazing defence mechanism: Protozoans may have been able to provide sufficient pressure [41]. In many systems, the biomass of protozoans often exceeds that of metazoans, in fact, protozoans are often the most important grazers on phytoplankton [46]. Unsurprisingly, a number of studies have demonstrated adverse effects of cyanotoxins on protozoans: For example, CYN is toxic to the amoeba Naegleria lovaniensis [47], and the protozoans Spirostomum ambiguum and Tetrahymena termophyla are both sensitive to MC [48]. Conversely, a number of protozoan grazers are known to actively feed and grow on toxic cyanobacteria [46,49]. The study by Fabbro et al. [49] found that the ciliate Paramecium caudatum was able to successfully graze on the CYN producer Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii; hence the probable reason that this ciliate regularly co-occurs with environmental blooms of that alga.;  This has implications for water managers as most freshwater storages, which are at risk of toxic blooms, have a pH that is close to circumneutral or slightly alkaline.;  Rather, the reverse seems to be true, with an increased abundance of toxigenic blooms being reported in the literature; however, this may result from increased scientific observations and reporting, rather than being a specific rise."

cancer,D009369,29113654,5726560,"More than 100 trillion microorganisms inhabit the human intestinal tract and play important roles in health conditions and diseases, including cancer.;  Consistent with these lines of evidence, clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown associations of specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis with gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.;  Emerging data demonstrate that intestinal bacteria can modulate the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-CD274 therapies, the process of absorption, and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery.;  A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.; Cancer in the gastrointestinal tract is a leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Accumulating evidence indicates that gastrointestinal tract cancers develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations, which are influenced by host immunity, diet, and environmental and microbial exposures [2].; The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms, which can influence the immune system and health conditions, including cancer [3–5]. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet, lifestyle, and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [6,7]. Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [8,9].; Here, we review clinical studies on intestinal bacteria in relation to gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.;  In addition, we describe emerging evidence for roles of intestinal bacteria in the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-CD274 therapies, the process of absorption, and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery.; Enterococcus faecalis has been shown to produce extracellular superoxide that induces DNA damage and genomic instability in colonic epithelial cells [14–16], and activates macrophages to produce 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which promotes colon carcinogenesis in Il10−/− mice [17,18]. In human gastric cancer cells, infection with Enterococcus faecalis causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage [19,20].; Fusobacterium nucleatum expresses the FadA virulence factor on the bacterial cell surface, which has been shown to bind to CDH1, activate the WNT signaling pathway in colorectal carcinoma cells, and promote colorectal tumor growth [43]. The Fap2 protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been shown to interact with T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) receptor and inhibit the activities of NK cells and T cells [44]. Emerging evidence indicates that the Fap2 protein can potentiate the attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum to colorectal cancers that express host polysaccharide Gal-GalNAc [45].; Intestinal bacteria produce diverse metabolites that can influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract tumors [4]. Polyamines, which are produced by host cells and gut bacteria, play important roles in diverse biologic and pathologic processes, including translation, gene regulation, stress resistance, and cell proliferation and differentiation [46]. Polyamines have been shown to suppress antitumor immunity and potentiate the proliferation of cancer cells, invasion and metastasis [47]. Colonic mucosal biofilms have been associated with up-regulation of polyamine metabolites that can enhance the proliferation of colon cancer cells [48].;  Clinical studies have shown that high-fat diets can increase bile secretion [49] and that high faecal concentrations of bile acids are found in colorectal cancer patients [50]. Experimental studies have shown that lithocholic and deoxycholic acid can activate the NFKB signaling pathway in colonic epithelial cells [51,52] and that deoxycholic acid can potentiate the development of colorectal tumors in rats receiving azoxymethane (AOM), a colorectal carcinogen [53]. A study based on a mouse model suggests that deoxycholic acid can promote the development of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma by damaging DNA [54].; The NLR family is a group of receptor proteins that respond to intracellular fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan and initiate the NFKB and MAPK signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells [67]. Studies have shown that activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) in colonic epithelial cells can induce inflammation through the up-regulation of chemokine CCL5 and promote colorectal tumor development through the up-regulation of IL6 expression in the tumor microenvironment [68,69]. In the mouse model of colorectal cancer liver metastases, NLRP3 in Kuppfer cells increase the production of IL18, which can activate the function of NK cells and suppress colon cancer metastatic growth in the liver [70]. On the other hand, NOD2 can induce microbial dysbiosis and potentiate the development of inflammation-induced colorectal tumors through up-regulation of IL6 expression in colonic epithelial cells, suggesting a protective role for NOD2 in the maintenance of the composition of the gut microbiota [71].; Adaptive immunity is specific to the type of pathogen that is encountered by B and T cells with subsequent generation of memory cells [72]. The microbiota play an important role in the differentiation of T cells [4]. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota produce butyrate, which can induce the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing T cells through interactions with GPR43, activation of histone deacetylase inhibition, and up-regulation of IL10 expression [55]. Accumulating evidence indicates that T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which produce IL17 and IL22, can promote tumor development and progression in the gastrointestinal tract [73–75]. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis induces TH 17 cells, which activate the STAT3 signaling pathway in tumor cells in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of colon cancer [76,77]. TH 17 cells also produce IL22, which has been shown to promote colorectal tumor development and progression [78,79]. IL23, which is mainly produced by tumor-associated myeloid cells that are likely to be activated by bacterial products, has been shown to promote colorectal tumor development and progression through the induction of TH17 cells in the microenvironment [75,80,81]. Fusobacterium nucleatum may inhibit T-cell-mediated immune responses against colorectal tumors through the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into the tumor microenvironment in the ApcMin/+ mouse model [44,82]. Recent study has shown an inverse association between the amount of tissue Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA and CD3+ T-cell density in human colorectal cancer tissue specimens [83].; These findings from the experimental studies described here provide insights into strategies for targeting the gut microbiome towards the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract cancer.;  ESCC constitutes the large majority of esophageal cancer cases worldwide and more than 90% of the cases in high-risk areas, such as China, Iran, and Japan [1]. EAC is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the United States [84]. Clinical studies have suggested associations of specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis (the condition of having imbalances in the microbial communities) with the development of ESCC and EAC (Table 1).; Clinical studies on specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in esophageal cancer; Yamamura et al. have reported that high amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with shorter cancer-specific survival and overall survival in esophageal cancers, including ESCC and EAC, and that the amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum correlates with tumor expression of chemokine CCL20.; In prospective epidemiological studies, chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori, which is a Gram-negative pathogen that selectively colonizes the gastric epithelium, has been associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of gastric cancer overall [94]. Helicobacter pylori is categorized as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.;  In addition to the infection with Helicobacter pylori, metagenomic studies have highlighted a potential link between gastric microbiota and gastric cancer (Table 2).; Clinical studies on specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in gastric cancer; Metagenomic analyses have shown a gradual decrease in microbial diversity from non-atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia to gastric cancer [95]. Among patients infected with Helicobacter pylori, microbial diversity is higher in gastric cancer compared with chronic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia [96,97].; Clinical studies on specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in colorectal cancer;  Studies have revealed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas compared with adjacent normal tissues [83,108–116]. Recent studies have demonstrated that a high amount of tissue Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with advanced disease stage [108,109,117], a lower density of T cells in colorectal carcinoma tissue [83], and worse patient survival [111]. Several studies have demonstrated that the proportions of colorectal cancers with specific molecular features such as microsatellite instability (MSI)-high, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high, and BRAF and PIK3CA mutations gradually increase along the bowel subsites from the rectum to the ascending colon [118–121]. The proportion of colorectal cancer enriched with Fusobacterium nucleatum increases linearly along the bowel subsites from the rectum to the cecum, suggesting a continuum model of pathogenic influences of intestinal bacteria on colorectal carcinogenesis [122]. Low fiber consumption and high meat intake have been associated with altered bacterial and metagenomic profiles [123,124]. Emerging data have shown that low fiber consumption and high fat intake are associated with an increased amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum measured by PCR in the stool [125]. Ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates, such as fiber, has been shown to increase colonic fermentation, and increase the transit of gut contents, and decrease the pH of the intestinal lumen [8], which might influence colonic colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum, although further investigations are required.; Clinical studies with a limited sample size suggest that the amount of Escherichia coli is higher in colorectal carcinoma tissue than in adjacent normal tissue and that a higher amount of Escherichia coli may be associated with advanced disease stage [126,127]. A few human studies have suggested a potential link between enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis and colorectal cancer.;  Studies suggest that enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is detected significantly more often in the colon mucosa tissue or stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls and that a higher amount of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is associated with advanced disease stage [116,128,129]. Although experimental studies suggest that Enterococcus faecalis may promote the development of gastric and colorectal tumors [14–18], one clinical study has suggested that Enterococcus faecalis is detected significantly more often in the stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls [130]. Studies have demonstrated that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus in human colorectal carcinomas is higher than in control tissue and that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus is correlated with the expression of PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in colorectal cancer tissue [131–133]. These findings suggest a potential role of Streptococcus gallolyticus in the development of colorectal tumors through inflammation.; These clinical studies have linked specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis to gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.; Emerging data demonstrate that intestinal bacteria can modulate the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies.;  Colorectal cancers with unresectable distant metastases are treated with chemotherapy regimens that are based on oxaliplatin and irinotecan combined with molecularly targeted therapies such as a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGFA (bevacizumab) and anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab) [134]. ROS are important for DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxaliplatin [135]. The administration of oxaliplatin to germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice has been shown to reduce oxaliplatin-mediated tumor cytotoxicity by down-regulating the production of ROS in myeloid cells, suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of oxaliplatin for gastrointestinal cancer by modulating the production of ROS in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment [136]. Irinotecan is converted to its active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), which is subsequently detoxified to an inactive, glucuronidated form, SN38-glucuronide (SN38G), by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 [137,138]. The bacterial β-glucuronidase then deconjugates SN38G to SN38, the active form, in the gut, which can cause severe diarrhea [139]. Bacterial β-glucuronidase-selective inhibitors have been shown to reduce the incidence of irinotecan-induced diarrhea in mice [140]. Cyclophosphamide, which is a prominent alkylating anticancer agent and one of several clinically important cancer drugs, can promote the differentiation of TH17 cells that may stimulate antitumor immunity in melanoma [141]. In a mouse model of melanoma, cyclophosphamide has been shown to induce the translocation of several Gram-positive bacterial species, including Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus, and Enterococcus hirae, to secondary lymphoid organs, and the administration of cyclophosphamide to germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice has been shown to reduce the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide by inhibiting the differentiation of TH17 cells and the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ T cells, suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence cyclophosphamide-mediated anticancer immunity [142]. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota can influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.; Therapeutic antibodies specific for immune checkpoint molecules, including CTLA4, PDCD1 (programmed cell death 1; PD-1), and CD274 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; PD-L1) can effectively enhance antitumor T-cell activity in various cancers, underscoring an important role of T-cell–mediated adaptive immunity in inhibiting tumor progression [143–145]. Studies using a mouse model have shown that the oral administration of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or Bacteroides fragilis to germ-free mice can enhance the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for CTLA4 [146] and that the oral administration of Bifidobacterium can potentiate the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for CD274 [147]. These findings suggest that manipulating the gut microbiota may modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.; Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome develops early in life and that once established, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life [148]. However, diet, lifestyle, pharmacological factors (including antibiotics), and probiotics and prebiotics have been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota [149–153]. Although further studies using human tumor tissue specimens are required for clinical application, we hope to utilize the gut microbiota to modulate the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapies in the future.; Surgery for gastrointestinal tract cancers and intestinal reconstructions has been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota.; Postoperative complications have been associated with tumor recurrence and a worse patient survival in gastrointestinal tract cancers [160–165]. Manipulating the gut microbiota by diet, lifestyle, antibiotics, and probiotics and prebiotics might become useful towards preventing the occurrence of postoperative complications and improving postoperative recovery after gastrointestinal tract surgery.; The main cause of gastrointestinal tract cancer-related death is distant metastasis, and the liver is commonly affected by distant metastases from primary gastrointestinal cancers.;  The liver is exposed to the gut microbiome via blood from the portal vein and hepatic artery and has many immune cell types, including T cells and macrophages [166]. Colorectal cancer patients with high-level T-cell infiltration in liver metastasis tissues exhibit high sensitivity to anticancer agents and have good prognosis [167]. Furthermore, emerging data have shown that there is a higher amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum in liver metastatic lesions from colorectal cancer compared with non-cancerous liver tissue [45]. Hence, intestinal bacteria might inhibit the anticancer immune response, and contribute to the formation of liver metastases from gastrointestinal tract cancers.; Experimental studies suggest that the gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and immunotherapies.;  Because the relationship between the complex gut microbiome and tumor cells in humans cannot be completely recapitulated in the mouse model, analysis using human cancer tissue is required for clinical application.;  Hence, interdisciplinary research in relation to oncology, microbiology, immunology, gastroenterology, pathology, and surgical oncology would provide valuable data for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the gut microbiome.;  A better understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota in the process of absorption after gastrointestinal reconstruction and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery may provide new opportunities to utilize the gut microbiota for postoperative recovery in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers."
cancer,D009369,21116414,2993000," A number of biologically active compounds with varying degrees of action, such as anti-tumor, anti-cancer, anti-microtubule, anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, photo protective, as well as antibiotic and antifouling properties, have been isolated to date from marine sources.; It is noteworthy that marine sources have also demonstrated tremendous abilities as producers of anti-cancer compounds and secondary metabolites which act against infectious diseases and inflammation.; Marine derived fungi have been widely studied for their bioactive metabolites and have proven to be a rich and promising source of novel anticancer, antibacterial, antiplasmodial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents [62,63]. Some marine fungi have unique new carbon frameworks which are exceptional in nature.;  These isolated compounds, when subjected to cytotoxicity analysis against 36 tumor cell lines, indicated significant cytotoxicity with great degree of selectivity for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer cells [79] suggesting their potential as anticancer drugs.;  Chemical examination yielded a novel alkaloid Lodopyridone, which was found to be cytotoxic (IC50 = 3.6 μM) to HCT-116 human colon cancer cells [81].; Marine actinomycetes are not only known for their anti-tumor and anti-cancerous potential, they are well documented as antimicrobial agents too.; Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria, also known as blue-green algae that produce an array of secondary compounds with selective bioactivity against vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, microalgae, fungi, bacteria, viruses and cell lines [86]. Some reviews in the past have proved that they produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites with antifungal, antiviral, antibiotic and other activities, which make them an interesting candidate of potential pharmaceutical importance [87,88]. Certain anticancer compounds, which were initially thought to be obtained from marine sources, are now known to be produced by cyanobacteria [89]. Ulithiacyclamide and Patellamide A belong to Cyanobactins, produced by cyanobacteria, which have potent antimalarial, antitumor, and multidrug reversing activities [90].;  Since then, a number of drugs such as Ara A (Vidarabine-Vira-A®), Ara C (antiviral) and synthetic analogue of Ara C- cytarabine (Cytosar-U®-anticancer) have successfully passed the trials to become clinically approved drugs of pharmaceutical importance [113]. Apart from this, Yondelis®, otherwise known as Ecteinascidin 743, has been approved in Europe for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma and another marine bioactive metabolite, the Conus toxin, also known as Ziconotide or Prialt® has been approved safe for intractable pain [114].;  Both of these compounds are promising anticancer agents.;  Interesting properties such as a broader and longer lasting proteasome inhibition, efficacy against a wider range of hematologic malignancies and many solid tumor models, less cytotoxicity to normal cells, higher in vivo potency and potential for both oral and intravenous administration makes Salinosporamide A a very promising anticancer agent [115]. Bryostatin 1 is a well known marine anticancer agent, initially thought to be produced by Bryozoa.;  These properties make it a promising anticancer agent for which the Phase I clinical trials are soon to begin [120]. With augmenting focus of research in the field of marine biotechnology, novel and potent compounds of biomedical interest are being discovered from the ocean bed, at a speedy rate."
cancer,D009369,21326924,3026423,"The use of bacteria in the regression of certain forms of cancer has been recognized for more than a century.;  Much effort, therefore, has been spent over the years in developing wild-type or modified bacterial strains to treat cancer.;  Recently, the old idea of using bacteria in the treatment of cancer has attracted considerable interest and new genetically engineered attenuated strains as well as microbial compounds that might have specific anticancer activity without side effects are being evaluated for their ability to act as new anticancer agents.;  Novel strategies also include the use of bacterial products such as proteins, enzymes, immunotoxins and secondary metabolites, which specifically target cancer cells and cause tumor regression through growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis induction.;  In this review we describe the current knowledge and discuss the future directions regarding the use of bacteria or their products, in cancer therapy.; Each year, tens of millions of people are diagnosed worldwide with cancer, and more than half of these patients eventually die from this disease.;  In 2002, 10.9 million new cancer cases (excluding skin cancer) were diagnosed, and the number of deaths caused by this disease reached 6.7 million (GLOBOCAN).1 Regarding the industrialized countries of the western world, cancer accounts for about one fifth of all deaths.;  Likewise, one person out of three will be treated for a severe cancer in their lifetime.2 In Europe, cancer has become a major public health problem with an estimated prevalence of about 3%, increasing to 15% at old age.3 This rising burden is mainly due to a rapidly aging population, and demands a clear and coordinated response from oncologists, public health professionals, policy-makers and researchers.; Conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often fail to achieve a complete cancer remission.;  This has prompted the development of many new approaches for the treatment of cancer.;  Coley, a surgeon in the Memorial Hospital in New York, described for the first time bacteria as anticancer agents.4 He observed that several patients showed tumor regression after being infected with pathogenic bacteria.;  Later, in 1935, Connell used sterile filtrates from Clostridium histolyticum to treat advanced cancers and observed tumor regression, which he pointed to be the result of enzymes' production.5 Many scientists since then, and even today, know that certain live, attenuated and engineered microorganisms such as Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Salmonella, Mycobacterium, Bacillus and Listeria have the ability to selectively target cancer cells and act as anticancer agents.;  They grow in the hypoxic core region of solid tumors, with very little oxygen and where most of the times radiation or chemotherapy are unsuccessful.6 Because of their selectivity for tumor micro-environment, these bacteria are also promising vectors for delivering therapeutic genes for anticancer therapies.; Another genus with promising results in anticancer treatment is Bifidobacterium.;  This is the most abundant genus inhabiting human colon and it has been used as a probiotic for many years.5 In the 1980s, it was shown that Bifidobacteria selectively grow in the hypoxic areas of solid mouse tumors upon intravenous injection of 5 × 106 cfu (colony forming units), and 96 hours after injection, virtually no bacteria were found in other tissues.24 Bifidobacterium not only inhibit cancer progression in mice but have also shown the ability to induce a powerful immune response, enhancing the killing activity of NK cells and recruiting the activity of IL-2, INFγ and INFα.25; Several genes have been cloned into natural Bifidobacterium plasmids. pBLES100 was used to clone spectinomycin adenyltransferase, transformed into B. longum 105-A or 108-A and introduced to tumor-bearing mice where they were found to colonize specifically tumoral tissues.26 The same thing happened when this strain was inoculated in rats with chemically induced tumors.26 Cytosine deaminase (CD) of E. coli was also cloned in pBLES100 under the control of a strong promoter (HU gene) and the B. longum strain carrying the recombinant plasmid was able to convert the prodrug 5-FC into 5-FU, suggesting the strain as an effective enzyme/prodrug therapeutic agent.27,28 The CD gene, cloned into the pGEX-1λT plasmid, was also transformed in B. infantis and the positive results obtained in a mice melanoma model also supported the hypothesis of using this genus in cancer gene therapy.29;  B. adolescentis presented around 70% inhibition when compared to control mice after a systemic administration.30B. longum (orally administrated) selectivelly recognizes xenographfted hepatocarcinoma cells.31 In addition, no biological effect or plasmid stability's lost occurred when selective antibiotic-resistance genes were removed, improving the ability of this system to act as a safe anticancer deliver gene therapy.32; Despite the great interest of using these plasmids in anticancer therapies since they are all commercially available, they have a high molecular weight, making it somehow hard to engineer.;  Bifidobacterium can inhibit cancer growth while it also enhances the immune system response, and growing in the host intestine, they can easily carry anticancer genes and become the reservoir of anticancer medicine.;  After showing the lower toxicity in several animal models, Pawelek and colleagues injected it into tumor-bearing mice and showed its specificity to tumors.35 Additionally, Salmonella strains were engineered to produce several proteins and toxins with anticancer activity: CD, TNFα, mitomycin C, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and colicin E3.;  More recently, reports have appeared of attenuated strains with the ability to delay tumor growth, including metastasis, in several models.5 A vaccine strain of Salmonella choleraesuis was developed and used both as a single anticancer agent and in combination with low-dose cisplatin (a platinum-based chemotherapy drug) in lung tumor and hepatocarcinoma in mice models.;  The ability of this strain to induce tumor regression was proved on a xenografted human prostate cancer.38 Although the results obtained with S. typhimurium A1 showed significant clinical potential, a new strain aiming at improving of the A1 tumor virulence was isolated.;  Results showed that this re-isolated strain was capable of adhering to cancer cells, using HT-29 as model system, about 6 times more than the parental A1 strain.;  Using the prostate cancer cell line PC3 as model, it was also seen that A1-R strain killed cancer cells in about 2 hours, whereas the strain A1 showed the same result only after 24 hours.39 The results obtained with A1-R were validated in other tumoral models.; In the specific area of increased immune responses, Listeria monocytogenes is another example of bacteria that can be used to treat cancer.;  Usually, patients diagnosed with this type of cancer present only a median survival time of 6–7 months, but the overall median survival time for those subjected to this clinical study was 2x fold higher (347 days), and three patients were still alive, over two years, at the time of the report (2009).56L. monocytogenes is not only a trigger of a potential immune response and an efficient antigen delivery system but mostly a new promising anticancer agent.; By far, the most successful case of live bacteria in the treatment of cancer is Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG).;  Its major application is in bladder cancer, where a complete response is given in approximately 80% of the patients.57 BCG was originally developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but in 1950s BCG was studied as an anticancer agent.;  Despite the encouraging effects in some tumor models, further clinical trials showed delayed hypersensitivity type reactions when tumor implantations were attempted in the locals of infection.6 In 1976, Alvaro Morales established a therapeutic protocol for bladder cancer treatment which took in consideration the time intervals needed for the hypersensitivity reactions to occur and considered, for the first time, intradermal BCG vaccination.;  It was the beginning of the successful story of BCG in bladder cancer treatment.; Not only live bacteria have applications in cancer therapies, but also bacterially-derived products have been tested and some of them successfully used for this purpose.;  The mode of action of some strains is through the production of cytotoxic factors, enzymes, antibiotics and others secondary metabolites that can be used or adapted in a proper manner to specifically target cancer cells.; A major aspect in cancer, related to bad prognosis of the cancer patients, is its ability to metastasize.;  Cancer metastasis occurs during tumor progression and cause 90% of human cancer deaths.;  This migratory behavior of cancer cells also occurs in embryonic development and immunity.69 Interestingly, bacteria naturally produce several chemokine/adhesion receptor inhibitors, so this appears as a new appealing approach as an anticancer therapy.; Staphylococcal superantigens-like (SSL) are a class of bacterial proteins produced by Staphylococcus aureus capable of binding several eukaryotic receptors overexpressed in cancer cells.; Some bacterial enzymes are also candidate therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.;  This is the case of the amino acid-degrading enzyme arginine deiminase of Mycoplasma arginini (Ma-ADI), a tumor growth inhibitor and potentially a therapeutic agent for the treatment of in vitro and in vivo tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer.72 Such inhibition of cancer cell growth by ADI is believed to be due to depletion of arginine.73 Interestingly, Ma-ADI has not only anticancer activity, but also has been implicated in inhibiting the growth of viruses such as HIV-1 and hepatitis C.74 These pleiotropic effects appear to suggest that the enzymatic activity of ADI, leading to arginine depletion, may not be the only contributing factor in the anticancer/antiviral activity of MA-ADI.;  Unlike the full size (46 kDa) protein, the truncated form had no ADI enzymatic activity, but presented anticancer activity in fibrosarcoma, breast cancer and leukemia cells.;  Thus, it appears that ADI's anticancer activity via enzymatic depletion of arginine is not the only way but a second potent route exists, which is through the N-terminal putative CARD-like domain without ADI activity.76;  While arginine is a non-essential amino acid in humans, certain cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma or renal cell carcinomas do not express ASS in vivo, making them sensitive to arginine deprivation due to ADI action.;  In the malignant melanoma clinical trials a higher anti-tumor activity was observed.86 Recent studies appear to indicate that a major advantage of ADI seems to be as a part of combinatorial therapies with interleukin 2, reducing the hypotension cause by nitric oxide, a common feature when high doses of IL-2 are given to patients, and its ability to cause nutritional stresses in cancer cells may be positive for the action of chemotherapeutic agents.; Recombinant immunotoxins based on Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE) are also promising anticancer agents.;  The B-domain is responsible for the interaction with eukaryotic host cell receptors, after which the A-domain translocates to the cytoplasma and exerts its action.88,89 Recombinant Exotoxin A-immunotoxins kill cancer cells by binding specifically to overexpressed cell-surface receptors, which carries them into the cell interior, where they arrest protein synthesis and induce apoptosis.87; Clinical trials with different Exotoxin A-immunotoxins have already been performed with positive results in leukemia and bladder cancer.88–93 However, it was frequently observed that these immunotoxins missed the ability to exert a strong cytotoxic activity against solid tumors, with better results obtained with hematologic tumors.94 These cells are more accessible for immunotoxins than solid tumors because these proteins need to overcome several natural barriers, which leads to the loss of their efficacy.;  Protein engineering has recently been developed to increase affinity towards cancer cells, increasing specificity, cytotoxicity and maximum tolerated doses in the treated mice and also PEGylated forms of immunotoxins were tested.95 Previous studies showed cytotoxicities were similar to the native form, but half-lives were prolonged and animal toxicity was considerably reduced.96; Microbial secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics and pigments, are also a source of new drugs for cancer treatment.; Activating K-ras mutations represents the most common type of abnormality of a dominant oncogene in human cancer, with specificity and type of mutation varying in relation to tumour type.98 Among the critical transforming alterations occurring in cancer it is widely accepted that mutations in K-ras are very frequent genetic somatic events, occurring in about 30% of all tumour types.;  Further, Ras activation is crucial to activate signaling pathways involved in cancer progression, namely proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and migration.;  Manumycin A is an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces parvulus and is one of the most studied, which has shown both in vitro cytotoxic activity against several cell lines (human pancreatic tumor, thyroid carcinoma, leukemias, myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma) and in vivo against human cancer xenografted models (pancreatic cancer and thyroid cancer).100–107 A combined treatment with Manumycin and Paclitaxel (a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy), had a synergistic cytotoxic effect on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.107 Angiogenesis and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor are also inhibited by this combination, showing higher cytotoxic effects than when used singly.;  In this cancer model, xenografted tumors in nude mice have also been inhibited by this metabolite.108; Overall, several farnesyltransferase inhibitors of microbial origin can induce apoptosis in cancer cells through the disruption of farnesylation or the farnesylated proteins, but more insights in the mechanisms are needed to optimize their use alone or combined with other chemotherapeutic agents.; Prodiginines are bacterial secondary metabolites with immunosuppressive and anticancer properties, characterized by a pyrrolydipyrromethene skeleton.;  The anticancer activity has been shown in several cancer derived cell lines (liver, spleen, blood, colon, gastric, lung, breast and chronic myeloid leukemia) and also in vivo in mice with a xenografted liver cancer.;  Moreover, these metalolites show little or no activity at all in normal cells.109 Prodiginines are capable of inducing apoptosis and act through different modes targeting multiple cellular pathways: (1) inducing or correcting DNA damage, (2) by cell cycle arrest; (3) changes of intracellular pH and (4) showing resistance to multidrug pumps that are often responsible for inducing resistance to other anticancer agents.;  Prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by many strains of the bacterium Serratia marcescens, is a prodiginine already tested against dozens of cancer cell lines exhibiting an average inhibitory concentration of 2.1 µM.110;  This new drug is now undergoing multiple phase I and phase II clinical trials against several forms of cancer both as a single agent and in combined therapies.109,111–113;  They show anti-tumor activity in cancer cell lines, many of those multidrug-resistant or paclitaxel-resistant (Taxol®, Bristol-Myers Squibb).114 Epitholones bind to the α, β-tubulin dimer of microtubules, inducing its polymerization and stabilization which causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition and apoptosis.;  Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated in vitro activity in breast, lung and colon cancer cell lines, amongst others.;  These natural drugs have shown an average activity one order of magnitude more potent than taxanes in cancer cell lines with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the sub or low nanomolar range.117,118 In murine xenograft tumor models with both intravenous and oral administration of ixabepilone, a second generation epothilone B,118 successful tests have been conducted, particularly for multidrug resistant models, such as MCF7/ADR and 16C/ADR breast, Pat-7 ovarian and HCT116/VM46 human colon carcinoma.119 Breast cancer models of metastasis have striking tumor growth inhibition when treated with ZK-EPO.120 Different schedules for drug administrations have been reported for different cancer models in order to determine the maximum tolerated doses and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).; It has now been demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces at least two cytotoxic proteins against cancer cells.;  Since J774 is a tumor cell line, it was of interest to see if azurin would demonstrate similar cytotoxicity towards human cancer cells.;  Melanoma (UISO-Mel-2)122 and breast cancer (MCF-7)123,124 were two models tested, where the efficacy of azurin to induce apoptosis and allow significant regression of these two cancers was demonstrated.;  In addition, intraperitoneal administration of azurin in nude mice xenografted with the two human cancer cells led to statistically significant tumor regression in vivo, with no apparent toxic effects to the animals.122,124; Recently, azurin and Laz have been demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxic activity against liquid cancers, in addition to the solid tumours already described.; So far, three different modes of azurin's action towards cancer cells have been proposed.;  Azurin has been shown to bind avidly to the intracellular tumour suppressor p53, stabilizing it and, thus, leading to increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Bax-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells;122,123,127 it also binds to several Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, a family of extracellular receptor proteins known to be upregulated in many tumors,128 and this binding with EphB2 interferes in its phosphorylation at the tyrosine residue, resulting in inhibition of cell signalling and cancer growth (Fig. 1).6; The mode of action of azurin in the induction of apoptosis and growth inhibition of a MCF-7 breast cancer cell is shown schematically.;  Azurin can enter the cancer cell to form a complex with tumor suppressor protein p53 (4 azurin molecules per 1 p53 molecule), stabilizing it and enhancing its intracellular level, which leads to apoptosis via caspase-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release pathways (A).;  Azurin can also bind avidly to the surface—exposed receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2, interfering in its binding with the ligand ephrinB2, and thereby preventing cell signaling that promotes cancer cell growth (B).;  Indeed, azurin has been shown to be secreted to the outside medium when P. aeruginosa cells are exposed to human cancer cells, but less so when exposed to normal cells.142 Azurin was proficient in entering the human cancer cells but was deficient in entering the normal cells.143 The entry of azurin in cancer cells has been studied by Yamada et al.143 through a series of GST fusions of truncated forms of azurin at the central, N- and C-terminal regions.;  The preferential entry of azurin in cancer cells has been identified to be a domain between amino acids 50 and 77 of azurin, termed p28, which can be used as a vehicle to transport cargo proteins.143 p28 forms an extended amphipathic helix with both a hydrophobic (amino acids 50 to 66) and a hydrophilic (amino acids 67 to 77) domain with antiangiogenic activity.144; A chemically-synthesized version of the p28 peptide has not only entry specificity in cancer cells, but similar to azurin, has been shown to interfere with angiogenesis, inhibiting the formation of capillary tube formation of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a dose dependent mode.6,145,146 Using a scratch wound migration assay, it was shown that p28 inhibited the migration of these cells in Matrigel, proving that this peptide has broad range effects in the morphological characteristic of angiogenesis.;  Interestingly, in addition to its ability to kill cancer cells, azurin and p28 can also interfere in oncogenic transformation to prevent precancerous lesion formation in mouse alveolar and ductal mammary glands exposed to a carcinogen Dimethyl-benz-anthracene (DMBA).147; Taylor et al.146 provided new information regarding the entry of the chemically-synthesized peptide p28 in human cancer cells.;  Recently, a start-up company CDG Therapeutics has initiated phase I human clinical trials of p28 for its anticancer activity (http://clinicaltrials.gov; clinical trials.gov identifier: {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT00914914"",""term_id"":""NCT00914914""}}NCT00914914).;  Different Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are present in distinct locations and some have been shown to be upregulated in some tumors, as it was for the EphB2 which is upregulated in gliobastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastrointestinal and renal carcinomas, and prostate, lung and ovarian cancers.128 Chaudari et al.128 tested three different cupredoxin proteins which exhibited structural similarities with the ephrinB2 ectodomain and found high values of interaction between azurin and EphB2 and also EphA6, using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).;  However, since both EphB2 and azurin have been involved in cancer cell signalling or cancer cell death, the authors proposed that this interaction could be a way of blocking the signalling process, antagonizing the Eph-ephrin mediated tumor progression (Fig. 1).; Unlike the rationally designed drugs that target a specific step in the signaling pathway involved in cancer, azurin intervenes in multiple pathways of cancer growth, thus exhibiting promiscuity.;  Azurin has structural similarity with variable domains of various immunoglobulins, thereby clearly demonstrating its single antibody-like structure as represented by ribbon drawing of eight antiparallel strands stabilized by a disulphide bridge-giving rise to a β-sandwich core, an immunoglobulin fold.147,148 It has a 28 amino acid (p28) extended a-helix PTD in the middle part that allows its entry specificity in cancer cells.;  By far the most interesting characteristic of azurin is its ability to bind various unrelated mammalian proteins relevant in cancer, conferring on it the property of a natural scaffold protein.148 The scaffold proteins are non-antibody recognition proteins belonging to different and divergent families but that demonstrate immunoglobulin-like binding characteristics.149 The ability of the azurin peptide p28 to act as a vehicle to carry cargo proteins inside cancer cells and azurin's ability to bind many different proteins because of its unique structural features makes azurin a potentially important natural scaffold protein for therapeutic purposes.;  A further development in the concept of “scaffold” implies the generation of azurin variants displaying multiple affinities to pre-defined targets relevant in cancers.; In the field of cancer drug discovery, recent developments are often related to rationally designed drugs, targeting a specific molecule or a signaling pathway.;  The use of high-throughput assays and combinatorial chemistry has supported the development of new synthetic chemical compounds with specific properties and structures directed to a specific receptor or protein that blocks a reaction or signaling cascade promoting cancer cell growth, survival and/or invasion.;  Different targets are used in anticancer drugs development, including those in growth signaling cascades and in DNA replication, cell division, angiogenesis and apoptosis.;  Overall different therapeutic modalities are now commercially available and in clinical practice, including monoclonal antibodies, drugs and prodrugs combinations and small natural or synthetic molecules.1,6 However, cancer cells, as with other disease agents, have the ability to mutate rapidly, causing a significant loss of therapeutic efficacy.;  This has prompted the development of novel and alternative approaches for the treatment of cancer.; Microbial-based therapy of cancer is one of the emerging cancer treatment modalities.;  Over the past few years, important advances have been made to study and develop live bacteria, with or without additional cloned genes that encode toxins targeted specifically to cancer cells, or bacterial products with cancer killing ability.;  Various types of obligate anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria can preferentially target cancer cells for growth in the hypoxic regions of the solid tumour.;  Attention has also recently been directed not only to the use of live bacteria, but bacterial proteins that can enter preferentially to cancer cells and disrupt their growth or kill them by multiple mechanisms.; During the past decade, cancer drug discovery or development is based on the single-target, single-compound paradigm.;  This concept contrasts with a more recent drug design approach, where a single drug can target with high efficacy multiple steps in cancer progression.;  Azurin induces apoptosis through complex formation with tumor suppressor protein p53 or inhibits growth of cancer cells by interfering in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling or preventing angiogenesis.150 In vivo cancer regression by azurin has also been demonstrated.;  The ability of a single bacterial protein, azurin, to interfere in the growth of cancer, is an interesting example of a potential drug candidate that can target multiple unrelated targets, interfering in multiple steps in the disease progression."

cancer,D009369,28764775,5540543," Fagonia indica has been recently investigated by numerous researchers because of its striking therapeutic potential especially in cancer.; 
Fagonia indica is a small spiny shrub that belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae present in warm and arid regions of the world, especially Asia and Africa [6]. Fagonia indica is of great ethno pharmacological importance with multiple therapeutic activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiseptic, anticancer, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory [7]. The plant is also used for the treatment of fever, thirst, vomiting, asthma, urinary discharge, dysentery, liver and stomach trouble, toothache, typhoid and skin diseases [8].;  It may also lead to pathological effects such as cancer and vascular diseases [28]. Among the extracts total antioxidant activity of S. maltophilia was the highest followed by E. cloacae strain.;  Deregulated phosphorylation at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues by protein kinases produced as a result of genetic alterations acquired early in tumorigenesis are often the cause of cancer.;  In this respect, inhibition of protein kinases has emerged as a promising target for cancer treatment [37]. Using streptomyces 85E as an assay strain for kinase inhibitors appears to identify a wide range of eukaryotic kinase modulators, presumably because the Streptomycete enzymes are evolutionary forerunners of their highly specific eukaryotic counterparts [38].;  B. subtilis is the source of surfactin antibiotic production as isolated and reported by [39]. Protein kinase activity is critical for the aerial hyphae formation of Streptomyces and this prerequisite has been exploited in the present study to bioprospect the extracts for their kinase inhibitory activity so that their anticancer potential could be assessed."

Apratoxin A is a fascinating structure composed of a polyketide section fused with a modified pentapeptide to form a cyclic lipopeptide and possessing a unique tertiary butyl group at one terminus.;  Moreover, apratoxin A shows an extremely promising profile of selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells grown on solid agar media as well as in vivo anticancer effects in a mouse model [17]. Recently, the mechanism of cytotoxic action of apratoxin A has been described as involving the reversible inhibition of a secretory pathway for several cancer-associated receptors through interference with their co-translational translocation [18]. As a novel structure working by a new mechanism to potently and selectively kill cancer cells, it becomes of interest to understand its biosynthetic pathway and underlying genetic architecture, as well as the chemical mechanisms used in creating some of its distinctive structural features.; In the course of locating and characterizing the biosynthetic gene cluster for the anticancer natural product apratoxin A (1), we utilized new, single cell methodologies and a novel strategy to overcome some inherent problems with current approaches.; The apratoxin A gene cluster is of particular interest due to the novelty of the chemical structure of the produced metabolite, the uniqueness of the biochemical reactions needed to produce several of its structural motifs, and its promising biological activity in cancer models."
cancer,D009369,29216824,5721385," In addition, the extracts were tested against two human cancer cell lines, cervical adenocarcinoma (SiHa) and lung carcinoma (A-549).;  Two extracts, referred to as A1SM3–29 and A1SM3–36, were also active against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the latter extract also showing slight cytotoxic activity against the assayed human lung cancer cell line.;  Despite the fact that most of the research on marine organisms has been focused on anticancer agents [3], the rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens has prompted an increase in research to identify compounds with antimicrobial activity.;  The WHO has classified carbapenem and 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae as a critical priority for new antibiotics, while vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were classified as high priority [15]. In addition, tracheal, bronchial and lung cancers are collectively the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Colombian men, while breast and cervical cancers are the most common cancers in women, causing 4.087 registered deaths between 2007 and 2012 in Colombia [16], highlighting the importance of continued research on natural products.; The crude extracts were tested for cytotoxic activity against two human cancer cell lines and one non-tumor cell line by an MTT cell proliferation assay [21] using Doxorubicin as a positive control [22, 23]. Human cervix epithelial cells (SiHa; ATCC® HTB-35™) and a human lung cancer cell line (A-549; ATCC® CRM-CCL-185™) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich Co., Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin 120 IU/mL and streptomycin 100 IU/mL; Gibco/Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Eurobio, France).; Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the extracts obtained from the 40 mixed cultures against the indicated multidrug resistant pathogens and human cancer cell lines;  A1SM3–36-8, which showed great antibacterial activity potential against the multidrug resistant pathogen MRSA and yielded good results for cytotoxic activity against the human lung cancer cell line A-549.;  This compound displayed an antibiotic activity against MRSA and cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines, HCT-116, A-549, AGS and DU145, suggesting that microbial competition can result in the production of novel chemical structures that could be potential drug candidates [54]. The second rationale is related to the fact that the strain responsible for the bioactivity in A1SM1–29 could not be isolated with the subcultivation techniques used in this study, in contrast to the results obtained for the A1SM3–36 mixed culture, from which the bioactive strain Vibrio sp."

cancer,D009369,28762997,5577590," This has led to the discovery of a growing number of medically relevant natural products, including novel leads for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and cancer.;  Throughout history, from acetylsalicylic acid to Taxol, many of the world’s most effective medicines have been derived from the products of organisms as diverse as plants, fungi, bacteria, and even mammals [1]. The increasing threat of antibiotic resistant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2], the lack of effective treatments for antibiotic resistant Gram- negative pathogens like Pseudomoas aeruginosa [3] and Escherichia coli O104:H4 [4], as well as the lack of effective treatments for major diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis [5] and various cancers, creates an impetus for discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents.;  One approach, once commonly used by industry but now largely driven by academic labs, involves the discovery of biologically active novel natural products [6]. A number of natural products from the marine environment have been approved as drugs including ziconotide, a peptide analgesic derived from the toxin of the marine cone snail Conus magus, and the anticancer agent trabectedin derived from the marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinate [7]. While the marine environment has been a fruitful source of novel molecular scaffolds and bioactive compounds, the industry is reticent to commit resources to natural product discovery in large part due to inherent problems with activity guided fractionation: frequently considerable time and resources are devoted to characterizing a biological extract before it is discovered that the bioactive molecule is already known [8].;  Didemnin B was the first marine natural product to enter clinical trials, being tested as an anti-cancer, anti-viral and immunosuppressive agent.;  Aplidine is also currently being investigated for treatment of other cancers at the phase I, II and III levels [36].; Tropodithietic acid (TDA) is a disulfide containing molecule produced by marine alphaproteobacteria of the genus Phaeobacter and shows antibiotic activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [51]. TDA has been investigated as a biocontrol agent for preventing vibriosis in aquaculture [52] and has potential anticancer applications due to its ability to disrupt the proton-motive force of a wide variety of cell membranes [53]. Phaeobacter and other members of the Roseobacter clade are notable for their symbiosis with marine algae, where the production of antibiotic compounds by Roseobacter appears to limit levels of marine Vibrio species that compete with the algae.;  Accordingly, phenylnannolone A can be used in combination with daunorubicin to improve the anti-cancer drug’s activity against resistant cells.;  Haliamide has cytotoxicity against the cervical cancer tumor cell line HeLa-S3 [168]. In vivo feeding experiments with 13C-labeled precursors conducted by Sun et al. showed that the biosynthetic building blocks of haliamide are benzoate, alanine, propionate and acetate [168]. The genome sequence of H. ochraceum SMP-2 determined by Ivanova et al. [169] was analyzed using antiSMASH [29], identifying a putative haliamide biosynthetic gene cluster (hla, 21.7 kbp) consisting of one gene encoding a NRPS/PKS hybrid, hlaA, and one gene encoding a PKS, hlaB, with putative sulfotransferase (ST) and thioesterase domains predicted to catalyze terminal alkene formation via decarboxylation [168]. In the proposed biosynthesis of haliamide (Scheme 12), benzoyl CoA acts as a starter unit."
cancer,D009369,23922738,3726634," We further investigated the biological activity of hierridin B, and tested its cytotoxicity towards a panel of human cancer cell lines; it showed selective cytotoxicity towards HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.; Marine cyanobacteria have been shown to produce a diverse array of biologically significant natural products with activity in models for anticancer, neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, and other areas [1]. Benthic, filamentous forms, in particular members of the classical (botanical) orders Oscillatoriales and Nostocales, have been the major sources of secondary metabolites reported from marine cyanobacteria [2]. This is in part explained by the fact that filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria appear to have larger genomes and thus can better accommodate sizable polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide pathways than picocyanobacteria [3], [4]. These classes of biosynthetic products make up the majority of secondary metabolites isolated from cyanobacteria thus far [2], although a previously unrecognized capacity to produce ribosomally-encoded modified peptides has recently been described [5], [6]. Another consideration is that some filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria grow to relatively high densities in coastal ecosystems, such as in mats or macroscopic tufts, thus yielding enough biomass for chemical investigations from environmental samples.;  Still, the related benzoquinone irisquinone [18] did not reveal any such selectivity in the NCI-60 cancer cell line screening program (NSC Number 614642), in which it showed an average potency in the low-to-mid micromolar range.;  Other benzoquinones, such as 3 and its longer-chain analogue, 2-methoxy-6-heptyl-1,4-benzoquinone, have been associated with anticancer activity [27]. To our knowledge, no putative natural roles have been put forward for 1."
cancer,D009369,28592323,5463493," MTT method, flow cytometry assay and DAPI staining were applied to test antiproliferative activity of selected extracts against MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (human prostate cancer) and HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cancer cells.;  X. parietina grown on PDA and G-LBM media decreased HeLa or MCF-7 cancer cells viability with IC50 values of about 8 μg mL−1, while C. pusilla grown on G-LBM medium showed the highest potency in decreasing MCF-7 (7.29 μg mL−1), PC-3 (7.96 μg mL−1) and HeLa (6.57 μg mL−1) cancer cells viability.; We showed that selected acetone extracts demonstrated a strong antimicrobial and anticancer effects that suggests that aposymbiotically cultured lichen-forming fungi can be a source of antibacterial and antiproliferative compounds.;  Caloplaca pusilla Zahlbr., Protoparmeliopsis muralis (Schreb.) Choisy and Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th.Fr.; 2) to test the impact of culture conditions on the growth of mycelia; 3) to evaluate antibacterial activity of mycelial extracts against several Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial strains and determine MIC and MBC values; 4) to test antiproliferative activity of selected extracts toward (i) MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, (ii) HeLa cervical cancer cells and (iii) PC-3 prostate cancer cells.; In this study 8 acetone lichen fungi extracts were examined for the anticancer potential toward (i) MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, (ii) HeLa cervical cancer cell line and (iii) PC-3 prostate cancer cell line.;  Cells were exposed for 48 h to increasing concentrations of lichen extracts (from 1 to 10 μg mL−1) and the viability of the cancer cells was determined with the use of MTT test.;  As shown in Table ​Table3,3, three extracts revealed anticancer activity with IC50 value lower than IC50 of usnic acid (6.57–8.41 vs 10.88–14.50 μg mL−1) i.e. extracts from Xanthoria parietina grown on PDA (labelled as Xp_PDA) and G-LBM (labelled as Xp_GLBM) media and Caloplaca pusilla grown on G-LBM medium (labelled as Cp_GLBM).;  Extracts from Protoparmeliopsis muralis did not show any anticancer activity in our study.
; Sensitivity (IC50) of different cancer cell lines to extracts after 48 h treatment;  Extract obtained from Caloplaca pusilla grown on GLBM medium revealed the highest potency in decreasing the cancer cell viability with IC50 values of 6.57 μg mL−1 for HeLa cell line, 7.29 μg mL−1 for MCF-7 and 7.96 μg mL−1 for PC-3 cell lines.; Effect of the extract on viability of HeLa (a), MCF-7 (b) and PC-3 (c) cancer cell lines. aExtract from mycelium of Caloplaca pusilla grown on G-LBM medium was used.;  However, higher concentrations of the mycelial extract (4–10 μg mL−1) elevated amount of cancer cells in the late stages of apoptosis (Annexin-V+/7-AAD+).; HeLa (a), MCF-7 (b) and PC-3 (c) cancer cells death assessed by labeling with annexin V and 7-AAD and flow cytometry. aCells were treated with different concentrations of extract from mycelium of Caloplaca pusilla grown on G-LBM medium (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 μg mL−1) for 48 h.; Morphology of HeLa, MCF-7 and PC-3 cancer cells treated with different concentrations of the extract. aCells were treated with the extract from mycelium of Caloplaca pusilla grown on G-LBM medium at different concentrations (0, 1, or 10 μg mL−1) for 48 h.; Moreover, acetone extracts from Xanthoria parietina showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells, with the greatest effect obtained at the concentration of 1.5–3 mg mL−1 of the extract [29]. In our study in vitro cultured mycelia of Xanthoria parietina grown on PDA (labelled as Xp_PDA) and G-LBM (labelled as Xp_GLBM) media proved to be a source of anticancer substances.;  They showed strong potency in decreasing the cancer cells viability with IC50 values of about 8 μg mL−1 for HeLa or MCF-7 cell lines (Table ​(Table33).;  However, the other nutrient media used for mycelial growth might stimulate the synthesis of other compounds with anticancer properties.;  However, Caloplaca pusilla grown on G-LBM medium (Cp_GLBM) showed the highest potency in decreasing the cancer cell viability with IC50 values of 6.57 μg mL−1 for HeLa cell line, 7.29 μg mL−1 for MCF-7 and 7.96 for PC-3 cell lines.;  Extract from Protoparmeliopsis muralis did not show antiproliferative effect although previous studies reported that compounds extracted from P. muralis inhibit the growth of selected cancer cell lines [25–27]. Although the growth of C. pusilla on G-LBM was limited, its extract showed the highest potency in decreasing the cancer cells viability, while the same mycobiont grown od PDA did not show any antiproliferative effect.;  A high variety of biologically active substances present in mycelial extracts may provide new antibacterial and/or anticancer agents."
cancer,D009369,27760211,5070912," Iturins are known to exhibit strong anti-fungal activity; for some iturins, cytotoxic activity towards mammalian erythrocytes and human cancer cell lines are described.;  The latter two activities have been described to rely on the ability of the iturins to interact with sterol present in eukaryotic cell membranes and to induce pore formation resulting in membrane permeabilization [24–26]. Most recently, iturin A has been described to possess moderate cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines by inhibiting Akt signaling and inducing apoptosis [27,28]. As expected for members of the iturin family, paenilarvins were active against yeasts and filamentous fungi but did not show any activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [22]. Further functional characterizations revealed that paenilarvins had cytotoxic activity against a mouse fibroblast cell line [22]. The proposed cytotoxicity of the paenilarvins led to their testing in larval toxicity assays."
cancer,D009369,28253280,5333925," Moreover, NoA exhibits a potent anti-proliferative activity (0.7–4.5 μM) against several human cancer lines, with p53-mutated cell lines being even more sensitive.;  Since cancers bearing p53 mutations are resistant to several conventional anti-cancer drugs, NoA may offer a new scaffold for the development of drugs that have the potential to target tumor cells independent of their p53 status.;  Those are five membered oxadiazoles and six membered oxadiazines [1, 2]. One of the few cases of natural occurrence are phidianidines, low molecular indole based metabolites containing 1,2,4-oxadiazole isolated from opisthobranch mollusk Phidiana militaris [3]. Much larger variability of oxadiazine and oxadiazole containing structures was generated via organic synthesis; mostly with 1,2,4 or 1,3,4 arrangement containing either O-N-C-N or O-C-N-N linkage, respectively [1, 4]. Up to date there is no report on natural metabolite containing a direct N-N-O linkage in the heterocycle (1,2,3-oxadiazine or 1,2,3-oxadiazole), although compounds containing 1,2,3-oxadiazole were synthetized via organic synthesis [5–7]. Majority of above mentioned structures exhibit interesting bioactivities including potential anticancer activity [2–4, 8]. Promising results obtained especially with 1,3,4-/1,2,4-oxadiazoles and 1,2,4-oxadiazines lead to structure-activity relationship studies.;  In several of the synthetic derivatives, some of which have been inspired by natural products, high efficiency against cancer cells in nanomolar range was detected [2, 3]. Thus oxadiazines and oxadiazoles are considered as an important chemical platform for novel anticancer compounds [2].; One of the common features of cancers is their resistance to a broad range of cell death stimuli.;  In the present study, we elucidate the highly unusual structure of NoA, show its anticancer potential in a panel of human cancer cell lines and demonstrate that NoA is causing caspase-dependent apoptosis.; Finally, we evaluated the anti-proliferative potency of NoA against a panel of nine cancer cell lines (Table 2).;  The observed IC50 values ranged from 0.72 μM to 4.50 μM, identifying NoA as a potential anti-cancer drug-candidate.;  Of note, increased sensitivity was actually found in the cancer lines with mutated or deleted p53 status.;  The most sensitive and least sensitive cell lines were the glioma cancer cell lines U251 and U87, respectively.;  Synthetic 1,3,4-oxadiazine derivatives manifested high efficiencies against cancer cells in nanomolar range [4]. Cancer cells are frequently escaping cell death, yet drugs inducing apoptosis are still a major pillar of current cancer therapies.;  Loss of p53 function is known to be responsible for drug-resistance in more than half of human cancers [32]. Apparently NoA induced cell death is independent of p53 function since we have observed full activation of caspase-3 and PARP-1 cleavage in HeLa cells lacking functional p53 and Rb protein [33]. On top of that p53 mutant cell lines exhibited even higher sensitivity to NoA best detectable in U251 glioma and JIMT1 breast cancer cells."

Indeed, an encouraging flow of novel anti-infection and anti-cancer compounds are being sourced from marine actinomycetes, as exemplified by the discovery of the abbysomicins, potent polycyclic polyketides active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and produced by “Verrucosispora maris” [30] and salinosporamide A, an anti-cancer compound produced by Salinispora tropica [31]. Marine Verrucosispora strains are also a source of novel proximicins, anti-tumor furan analogues of the antibiotic netropsin [32].;  In addition, 9 out of the 343 cytotoxic strains showed activity against aurora kinase A, a protein related to an indicator of anti-cancer activity.;  Isolates from this site and from the mangrove at Wenchang were particularly effective in the anti-infective and anti-cancer assays.;  However, it is clear from the present study that actinomycetes isolated from mangrove habitats can be expected to provide high quality biological material for high through put biochemical, anti-cancer and anti-infection screening programmes."

carcinogenesis,D063646,29113654,5726560," Other bacterial species have been shown to produce short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract.; The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms, which can influence the immune system and health conditions, including cancer [3–5]. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet, lifestyle, and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [6,7]. Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [8,9].; Intestinal bacteria have been shown to potentiate carcinogenesis through specific toxins that induce DNA damage.;  Colibactin is encoded by the polyketide synthase island, which is expressed by Escherichia coli from phylogroup B2, and has been shown to induce DNA damage, affect genomic instability [10,11], and promote colon carcinogenesis in Il10−/− mice [12,13].; Enterococcus faecalis has been shown to produce extracellular superoxide that induces DNA damage and genomic instability in colonic epithelial cells [14–16], and activates macrophages to produce 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which promotes colon carcinogenesis in Il10−/− mice [17,18]. In human gastric cancer cells, infection with Enterococcus faecalis causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage [19,20].; Accumulating evidence indicates that SCFAs such as butyrate, which are produced by the gut microbiota, can suppress colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis by blocking activation of the NFKB signaling pathway and inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing T cells [55–57]. Experimental studies have shown that butyrate can function as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation, stimulate apoptosis, and suppress colonic tumor development [58–61]. In contrast, emerging data demonstrate that low concentrations of butyrate may promote the growth of colonic tumors that exhibit DNA mismatch repair deficiencies in a mouse model [62].; Zaidi et al. have reported that a high amount of Escherichia coli in esophageal tissues is associated with Barrett’s esophagus, EAC, and increased expression of TLRs [91]. A high amount of Campylobacter concisus in esophageal tissues is associated with Barrett’s esophagus and increased expression of IL18, which is associated with carcinogenesis [92].;  Studies have revealed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas compared with adjacent normal tissues [83,108–116]. Recent studies have demonstrated that a high amount of tissue Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with advanced disease stage [108,109,117], a lower density of T cells in colorectal carcinoma tissue [83], and worse patient survival [111]. Several studies have demonstrated that the proportions of colorectal cancers with specific molecular features such as microsatellite instability (MSI)-high, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high, and BRAF and PIK3CA mutations gradually increase along the bowel subsites from the rectum to the ascending colon [118–121]. The proportion of colorectal cancer enriched with Fusobacterium nucleatum increases linearly along the bowel subsites from the rectum to the cecum, suggesting a continuum model of pathogenic influences of intestinal bacteria on colorectal carcinogenesis [122]. Low fiber consumption and high meat intake have been associated with altered bacterial and metagenomic profiles [123,124]. Emerging data have shown that low fiber consumption and high fat intake are associated with an increased amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum measured by PCR in the stool [125]. Ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates, such as fiber, has been shown to increase colonic fermentation, and increase the transit of gut contents, and decrease the pH of the intestinal lumen [8], which might influence colonic colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum, although further investigations are required.;  However, there are considerable study-to-study differences regarding reported bacterial species associated with colorectal carcinogenesis, which may be due to limitations including small sample sizes, undefined tissue sampling sites, and limited data on clinical features and tumor molecular features."

colonic,D003110,22016433,3345969," To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H2S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.;  Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota.; Next-generation pyrosequencing can be applied to further evaluate the functional capacity of the colonic microbiota by creating a catalog of the genetic potential of the microbiota.;  Some of these end products have been shown to be protective to the colonic epithelium, and others have proved to be proinflammatory or procarcinogenic metabolites (3, 48).;  By using knowledge of these specific metabolites, a hypothesis-driven targeted approach can be applied to evaluate changes in colonic metabolism following dietary interventions or during different disease states, for example, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate and protein fermentation, secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.; The colonic microbiota ferment endogenous host-derived substrates such as mucus, pancreatic enzymes, and exfoliated epithelial cells, as well as dietary components that escape digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract.;  Two main types of colonic microbial fermentation can be distinguished, including saccharolytic fermentation of carbohydrate and proteolytic fermentation of protein (Fig. 2).;  The main products of carbohydrate metabolism are short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which have been shown to contribute to colonic health.;  SCFA provide energy to the colonic epithelial cells, decrease luminal pH, and improve mineral absorption.; Different metabolites produced from colonic fermentation of carbohydrates and proteins.;  For example, a lower butyrate-to-acetate ratio has been found in colonic luminal content of patients with adenomatous polyps or colon cancer compared with healthy controls (107), and increased amounts of SCFA were found in fecal samples from obese compared with lean individuals (89).;  In another study, stable isotope tracers were applied to determine the production rate of acetate during colonic fermentation of lactulose in humans.;  The colonic acetate production was calculated from the reduction in the plasma [13C]acetate enrichment as a result of the colonic fermentation of lactulose (77).;  A number of these retained solutes originate from colonic bacterial protein metabolism (33).;  Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been found to provoke genomic DNA damage in colonic cancer cells (HT-29 cells) in concentrations similar to those found in the human colon (6).;  The formed [15N]ammonia can be either taken up by the colonic microbiota, followed by fecal excretion, or absorbed through the mucosa and renally excreted after conversion to [15N]urea in the liver.;  Thus a shift of nitrogen excretion from urine to feces can be explained by increased bacterial protein synthesis and a subsequent decrease in colonic absorption of nitrogen in the form of ammonia.;  The removal of ammonia from the colonic lumen might be considered a health benefit, since it may prevent ammonia from damaging colonocytes (87) and increased systemic levels of ammonia cause neurotoxic effects (106).; Lactose[15N,15N′]ureide is resistant to digestion but is fermented by colonic bacterial enzymes into [15N,15N′]urea and subsequently [15N]ammonia (NH3).;  The proportionate recovery of 15N in feces or urine indicates the degree of colonic protein fermentation.;  This decrease may be related to the increased production of SCFA, since SCFA decrease the colonic pH.;  Secondary bile acids may have a cytotoxic effect on the colonic epithelium.;  Sulfatases are involved in the degradation of mucosal glycans, such as colonic mucins (14).; New techniques such as metabolomics allow evaluation of the colonic metabolism by a top-down approach, bypassing the need for an a priori hypothesis.; Changes in colonic metabolism can be evaluated following a targeted approach or a top-down approach.;  Until now, the described biomarkers of bacterially mediated colonic metabolism can only be regarded as intermediate end points."

colorectal cancer,D015179,25527542,4309719," A prominent example is colibactin, a largely unknown family of secondary metabolites produced by Escherichia coli via a hybrid NRPS-PKS biosynthetic pathway that inflicts DNA damage upon eukaryotic cells and contributes to colorectal cancer and tumor formation in the mammalian gut.;  This hybrid NRPS-PKS pathway produces a family of largely uncharacterized small molecules termed “colibactin.” The presence of this gene cluster (clb) in E. coli results in DNA damage of eukaryotic cells (28) and contributes to inflammation-induced colorectal cancer in the mammalian gut (30, 31).;  These bacteria typically colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans, where the putative colibactins are hypothesized to exert genotoxic activity on host cells, resulting in DNA damage linked to tumorigenesis, colorectal cancer, and gut inflammation (28, 30, 31).;  Do the similar in vitro phenotypes caused by F. perrara and E. coli (Fig. 5) indicate similar functions of the Clb GI in vivo?

colorectal cancers,D015179,29113654,5726560," Consistent with these lines of evidence, clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown associations of specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis with gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.; Here, we review clinical studies on intestinal bacteria in relation to gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.; Fusobacterium nucleatum expresses the FadA virulence factor on the bacterial cell surface, which has been shown to bind to CDH1, activate the WNT signaling pathway in colorectal carcinoma cells, and promote colorectal tumor growth [43]. The Fap2 protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been shown to interact with T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) receptor and inhibit the activities of NK cells and T cells [44]. Emerging evidence indicates that the Fap2 protein can potentiate the attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum to colorectal cancers that express host polysaccharide Gal-GalNAc [45].;  Studies have revealed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human colorectal adenomas and carcinomas compared with adjacent normal tissues [83,108–116].

In addition, some species are notable for their ability to cause important crop diseases such as potato common scab (CS), which is characterized by the formation of superficial, erumpent (raised) or pitted lesions on the potato tuber surface [2].

cyclic lipodepsipeptides,C536899,28335605,5368682," As a means to investigate natural products from
these microorganisms, an opportunistic sampling protocol was developed,
which focused on exploring bacteria isolated from roadkill mammals.
This initiative was made possible through the establishment of a newly

biologically active metabolites from microbiome-associated bacteria.
To illustrate this process, this report focuses on samples obtained
from the ear of a roadkill opossum (Dideiphis virginiana) as the source of two bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp.) that produced several new
and known cyclic lipodepsipeptides (viscosin and serrawettins, respectively).
These natural products inhibited biofilm formation by the human pathogenic
yeast Candida albicans at concentrations well below

cystic fibrosis,D003550,20111686,2812829," This review discusses the bioactivity of several phytoalexins and phytoanticipins defending plants against fungal and bacterial aggressors and those with antibacterial activities against pathogens affecting humans such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus involved in respiratory infections of cystic fibrosis patients.;  Furthermore, since bacterial biofilm development is an important quorum sensing-mediated process needed for host tissue colonization by pathogens such as P. aeruginosa in respiratory infections of cystic fibrosis patients, Bjarnsholt et al. [71] tested the prophylactic properties of garlic extracts in a pulmonary mouse model of infection.;  This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that pseudomonal quorum sensing signalling molecules such as N-acyl homoserine lactones can be detected in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients [72,73] and that such signalling molecules were shown to have immunomodulatory activities [74,75].;  Furthermore, we are currently also assessing the anti-virulence activity of tomatidine on S. aureus small colony variants (SCV) which are slow-growing respiratory deficient derivatives often found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients [85]. We have previously shown that SCV from cystic fibrosis patients have a transcriptional signature of their own that results in expression of virulence factors involved in host tissue colonization, cellular invasion and biofilm formation, which are likely to play a role in chronic infections [86–88]. We found that biofilm production, which was very elevated in SCV compared to prototypical S. aureus strains, was specifically inhibited by tomatidine at subminimal inhibitory concentrations [88]. These results indicate that tomatidine has an overall effect on virulence determinants in S. aureus and may eventually provide a new avenue for the management of both acute and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients."

cytotoxicity,D064420,27760211,5070912," However, we could neither demonstrate cytotoxicity of paenilarvins towards cultured insect cells nor towards larvae in feeding assays.;  The latter two activities have been described to rely on the ability of the iturins to interact with sterol present in eukaryotic cell membranes and to induce pore formation resulting in membrane permeabilization [24–26]. Most recently, iturin A has been described to possess moderate cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines by inhibiting Akt signaling and inducing apoptosis [27,28]. As expected for members of the iturin family, paenilarvins were active against yeasts and filamentous fungi but did not show any activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [22]. Further functional characterizations revealed that paenilarvins had cytotoxic activity against a mouse fibroblast cell line [22]. The proposed cytotoxicity of the paenilarvins led to their testing in larval toxicity assays.; Previously, the hypothesis that paenilarvins might act as virulence factors of P. larvae ERIC II was partly based on their cytotoxicity towards a mouse fibroblast cell line [22]. For this mammalian cell line, an IC50 of 4 μg/mL was determined [22]. Since vertebrate/mammalian and invertebrate/insect cells might differ in their susceptibility towards paenilarvins, we tested the cytotoxicity of purified paenilarvin A/B towards the insect cell line BTI-Tn5B1-4 derived from the moth Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera).;  This cell line has previously been used to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of the novel P. larvae secondary metabolite paenilamicin [17,20,21]. Cells were incubated for 48 hours with paenilarvin A/B or jellein IV added to the cell culture medium at different concentrations (2 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL, 6 μg/mL).;  Still, to further substantiate the negative outcome of our exposure bioassays and larval feeding assays, we also performed cell toxicity assays with an insect cell line already successfully used to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of paenilamicin [20], another secondary metabolite of P. larvae [17,21]. Because iturins interact with cell membrane components which might differ between mammalian and insect cells, a difference in susceptibility between these cell types towards a certain lipopeptide seemed likely.; The putative in vitro cytotoxicity of paenilarvin was tested by using the insect cell line BTI-Tn5B1-4 (derived from Trichoplusia ni, Lepidoptera) obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany).;  Cell maintenance and cytotoxicity assays were performed essentially as described before [20]. Paenilarvin A/B purified from culture supernatants (see above) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and stored at -80°C until further use.;  For cytotoxicity assays, BTI-Tn5B1-4 cells were incubated for 48 h either in SF 900 II medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) or in SF 900 II medium supplemented with purified paenilarvin A/B (treatment) or jellein IV (negative peptide control)."

death,D003643,20659313,2915981," Carolacton caused death of S. mutans biofilm cells, elongation of cell chains, and changes in cell morphology.; Phase contrast/fluorescence microscopy in combination with LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability staining (details see below) revealed that the majority of the biofilm cells of S. mutans grown anaerobically in the presence of carolacton (5.3 μM) showed red fluorescence, indicating damaged membranes and possibly death of the cells (Figure ​(Figure2D),2D), while planktonic cells were fluorescing green like untreated controls (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B).;  Figure ​Figure33 shows that the number of CFU in carolacton treated biofilms was only 5 - 15% compared to untreated controls, thus confirming that carolacton induced cell death.;  Disaggregation of these chains by sonification failed to yield individual cells or short chains comparable to untreated cultures and led to more or less complete cell death.; The data show that in biofilms carolacton causes membrane damage and cell death as well as morphological changes, e.g. elongated cells, increased chain length and bulging.;  We hypothesized that carolacton might induce cell death and possibly reduced acid tolerance (resulting in elongated or bulged cells) by interfering with the competence and stress related cell-cell signalling network in S. mutans.;  This network is comprised in part of pheromone CSP (the comCDE system)-dependent and CSP independent components which respond to environmental signals [40,42,43]. CSP can trigger cell death at high concentrations by inducing an auto-active intracellular bacteriocin, CipB, in a fraction of the biofilm cells [42]. In some ways the activity of carolacton is similar to that of CSP at concentrations above those that induce competence.;  CSP and carolacton both induce balloon like cell morphology, and cell death in about 50% of the biofilm cells, an effect which was not increased by increasing their concentration [33]. Unlike carolacton (see below), CSP activity is exclusively mediated through comDE, i.e. the comC and comD null mutants were insensitive to CSP [33]. We studied the response of mutants lacking functional comC, comD or comE to carolacton.; Other mechanisms could also contribute to cell death in a growth dependent way."

Another nocardial strain (GAM-5) has also been shown to induce impaired movements and similar pathological features in mice following sublethal infection [49]. Characterization of culture filtrates from strain GUH-2 indicated that a non-lipid, small molecular weight, secreted substance may be responsible for DA-depleting effects [50]. While the chemical profile of the S. venezualae neurotoxic factor is distinct from the nocardial metabolite, taken together, these reports emphasize the potential impact of bacterial exposures on neurodegeneration."

(b) Different types of mycelia observed under the confocal and electron microscopes.;  This might be attributable to the relatively high cell densities attained in laboratory culture conditions, which provoked massive cell death, differentiation, and sporulation.;  It is clear that in nature, cell death and sporulation must take place at the end of the long vegetative phase (Wellington et al., 1990; Anukool et al., 2004) when the nutrient imbalance gives rise to bacterial differentiation.; Bacterial PCD can be defined as any type of genetically controlled cell dismantling involving the activation of specific cell death transducers, regulators, and effectors (Engelberg-Kulka et al., 2006).; Miguelez et al. (1999) and Manteca et al. (2006a) demonstrated that Streptomyces death phenomena associated with development present the characteristics of programmed cell death.;  Among these enzymes there was a precursor of sequence non-specific nucleases involved in massive chromosomal degradation (Nicieza et al., 1999) and the sequence-specific nuclease (endoG) that produced chromosomal bands analogous to those that appear in the programmed cell death of eukaryotic cells (apoptosis) (Cal et al., 1996; Samejima & Earnshaw, 2005)."
death,D003643,18534010,2442094," Metabolic pathways, such as fermentation and a methionine salvage pathway, have been identified, as have genes for programmed cell death that may be related to the rapid disappearance of Microcystis blooms in nature.; Dated approximately 3 billion years old by fossil records, cyanobacteria were the first oxyphototrophic prokaryotes present on Earth [1]. As architects of the Earth's atmosphere they had a major impact on the evolution of aerobic metabolism and the evolution of life [2]. Cyanobacteria still play a fundamental role in the functioning of global ecosystems by significantly contributing to carbon fluxes [3,4] and by providing nitrogen used for primary production [5]. On the other hand, cyanobacterial blooms may lead to a loss of biodiversity in the phytoplanktonic communities and, by generating very high quantities of organic matter used by anoxygenic bacteria in the bottom layers of water resources, can cause massive death of fish by asphyxia [6]. The financial costs resulting from cyanobacterial proliferations are considerable (e.g. 200 million Australian dollars/year in Australia) [7].; In natural populations of Microcystis, oxidative stress was shown to induce programmed cell death (PCD) [46]. Accordingly, 5 putative eukaryotic caspase-like genes were identified by PSI-Blast in the genome of strain Mic-PCC7806.;  PCD might thus be triggered when Microcystis cells are exposed to severe environmental stress conditions, leading to the rapid decline of blooms, as has been suggested by Berman-Frank et al. in the case of Ter-IMS101 [47]. Mic-PCC7806 and Mic-NIES843 are the only unicellular cyanobacteria known to have genes coding for HstK-like kinases (mic1879 and mic1015), proteins characterized by the presence of both His and Ser/Thr kinase domains [48,49]. Some of these kinases are implicated in either the iron homeostasis/oxidative stress response or in the differentiation of N2-fixing cells in filamentous cyanobacteria [[48,49] and C-C Zhang, unpublished data]. Cell differentiation does not occur in M. aeruginosa, but it would be interesting to test whether these HstK-like protein kinases are involved in iron homeostasis and/or in the control of programmed cell death in response to oxidative stress."

We have adopted this method for the in vitro anti-Xylella activity assay.;  Our results showed that X. fastidiosa growth is more susceptible to the above-mentioned phenolic compounds than the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tested in [18].; Phenolic acids with methoxy (–OCH3) substitutions (ferulic acid and sinapic acid) are less effective in inhibiting X. fastidiosa growth (Table 2).;  Compared to phenolic acids, flavonoids generally have strong inhibitory activities against X. fastidiosa growth, except for rutin (quercetin glycoside), which is less active than the corresponding aglycone quercetin (Fig. 1; Table 3).;  We tested a representative of coumarins that has no structural modifications and found that it is less effective in inhibiting X. fastidiosa growth than the flavonoid aglycones (Table 3).;  However, it is notable that catechin inhibits X. fastidiosa growth at 3.4 mM for the citrus strain and at no more than 400 μM for the grapevine strains (Table 3; [16]).; Our studies showed that low-molecular weight plant secondary metabolites, specifically phenolic compounds, can inhibit X. fastidiosa growth in vitro.;  However, the mechanism for X. fastidiosa growth inhibition by phenolic compounds is still unknown."
filamentous,C579880,23922738,3726634," The majority of such compounds have been isolated from so-called complex cyanobacteria, such as filamentous or colonial forms, which usually display a larger number of biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes, when compared to free-living unicellular forms.;  This compound had previously been isolated from the filamentous epiphytic cyanobacterium Phormidium ectocarpi SAG 60.90, and had been shown to possess antiplasmodial activity.; Marine cyanobacteria have been shown to produce a diverse array of biologically significant natural products with activity in models for anticancer, neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, and other areas [1]. Benthic, filamentous forms, in particular members of the classical (botanical) orders Oscillatoriales and Nostocales, have been the major sources of secondary metabolites reported from marine cyanobacteria [2]. This is in part explained by the fact that filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria appear to have larger genomes and thus can better accommodate sizable polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide pathways than picocyanobacteria [3], [4]. These classes of biosynthetic products make up the majority of secondary metabolites isolated from cyanobacteria thus far [2], although a previously unrecognized capacity to produce ribosomally-encoded modified peptides has recently been described [5], [6]. Another consideration is that some filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria grow to relatively high densities in coastal ecosystems, such as in mats or macroscopic tufts, thus yielding enough biomass for chemical investigations from environmental samples.;  Compound 1 had previously been isolated from the marine filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium ectocarpi strain SAG 60.90 and showed antiplasmodial activity [9]. We show that both cyanobacterial strains possess polyketide synthase (PKS) biosynthetic machinery, which is predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of hierridin B.;  Based on these morphological characteristics, the cyanobacterium was identified as Cyanobium sp., according to Komarék and Anagnostidis [10]. This identification is also in accordance with the criteria of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [11]. Since hierridin B had been previously reported from the filamentous cyanobacterial strain P. ectocarpi SAG 60.90 (see morphology comparison in Fig. 3), we performed a 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis to clarify the evolutionary relatedness between the two hierridin B producing cyanobacterial strains.;  PCC 7001; interestingly, the PCC 7001 sample was also isolated primarily from intertidal sediments [11]. This analysis also identifies that Phormidium ectocarpi SAG 60.90 is very closely related to other marine, phycoerythrin-rich filamentous cyanobacteria, including the reference strain Leptolyngbya sp.;  The recently reported biosynthetic route to the cylindrocyclophanes in the filamentous heterocystous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum licheniforme
[20] involves an alkylresorcinol intermediate (6) that is structurally related to hierridin B.;  PCC 7335 and the filamentous cyanobacterium Prochlorothrix hollandica PCC 9006 (axenic strain, co-identical with SAG 10.89 [21]).;  Interestingly, this compound had been previously isolated from a phylogenetically distant filamentous cyanobacterium.;  Several available cyanobacterial sequences from unicellular and filamentous non-heterocystous “Bergey's reference strains” [11] were included in the analysis."

fitness,D012640,21764930,3165673," Next, a role of TA production in myxobacterial fitness was assessed by measuring swarm expansion.;  Here, the TA− mutant had a specific swarm rate reduction on prey lawns, and thus reduced fitness, compared to an isogenic TA+ strain.;  In the case of antibiotics, it has long been assumed they might play a fitness advantage to producer organisms by killing or inhibiting the growth of competitors.;  In contrast to the killing assay, this method allows predator fitness to be assessed.;  In sum, these results suggest that the TA− mutant has a reduced fitness to handle E. coli prey.; In reciprocal experiments, the fitness of DK1622 on E. coli prey either overexpressing LspA (TAr) or not (TAs) was again assessed by monitoring swarm expansion.;  Thus, under the described conditions, TA production or potency toward prey contributes toward M. xanthus fitness as judged by swarm expansion.; Swarm expansion assays independently found that TA activity contributes toward M. xanthus predatory fitness (Fig. 6 and ​and7).7)."

fitness,D012640,22110622,3217935," The production of antimicrobial compounds is expected to incur fitness costs for the producing bacteria.; We measured the possible cost of antibiotic production for Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 by monitoring changes in growth rate with and without induction of antibiotic production by supernatant of a bacterial competitor, namely Pedobacter sp.. Experiments were performed in liquid as well as on semi-solid media under nutrient-limited conditions that are expected to most clearly reveal fitness costs.; Interference competition is an important strategy of bacterial strains to establish and maintain themselves within microbial communities [1]. A well-known mechanism of bacterial interference competition is the production of antibiotics [2]. These secondary metabolites can be targeted against more or less closely related strains and species (e.g. bacteriocins) or against a wide range of competitors (e.g many polyketides) [3], [4], [5]. Theoretical models have demonstrated that, instead of decreasing diversity by leaving only the most aggressive strains, microbial warfare could actually promote diversity, with dynamic coexistence of many strains differing in their antibiotic production and sensitivity profiles [1], [6], [7], [8]. These results are obtained when it is assumed that both resistance to- and production of antibiotics come at a fitness cost, resulting in a reduced growth rate.; Because of its profound relevance to human health, the fitness cost of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has received far more attention than the fitness cost of bacterial antibiotic production.;  Whereas it has emerged that the majority of bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms comes at a fitness cost [9], as predicted by theory [10], few studies have examined the cost of antibiotic production.;  Indications for biological costs of antibiotic production or antibiotic resistance are generally obtained by comparison of relative fitness of wild-type strains with that of antibiotic-negative mutant strains (e.g. [11], [12]).;  In the current study we used both approaches to quantify the possible fitness cost of antibiotic production in P. fluorescens Pf0-1: 1) comparison of the growth rate of the wild-type with and without induction of antibiotic production and 2) comparison of the growth rate of wild-type and non-antibiotic producing mutants under conditions that induce antibiotic production.; Whilst we did not observe significant costs of antibiotic production here, biological costs associated with antibiotic resistance have been reported to vary from significant (e.g. [9], [33], [34]), to no-cost (e.g. [14], [35], [36], [37]) to even enhanced fitness (e.g. [37]).;  Mutations conferring resistance arising in sensitive cells often modify the molecule targeted by the antibiotic in such a way that, although the cell is protected from the antibiotic, its function is severely compromised [9]. Such non-additive, pleiotropic fitness costs often are severe.;  In addition, compensatory mutations that mitigate pleiotropic fitness costs have been identified in resistant bacteria [9]. It could be that compensatory mutations are more readily accessible for genetic systems mediating antibiotic production than they are for resistance mutations thus lowering the fitness cost in the former."
fitness,D012640,24425772,3910598," Here we study the link between QS input (signaling) and QS output (response) in the ComQXPA QS system of Bacillus subtilis by characterizing the phenotype and fitness of comQ null mutants.;  This surfactin overproduction is associated with a strong fitness cost, as resources are diverted away from primary metabolism.;  We provide the first evidence that QS signal-deficient mutants have an overactive QS response in the presence of the exogenously provided signal that results in overproduction of public goods and a dramatic loss of fitness.; We further investigated whether the increased surfactin production observed for the undomesticated PS216ΔcomQ strain in the presence of ComX is associated with the negative fitness effects.;  Similarly, negative fitness effects were observed for PS216ΔcomX, which also showed increased surfactin production (Fig.;  In contrast to PS216ΔcomQ, no dramatic fitness effect was observed for the PS216ΔcomQΔsrfA double mutant, strongly supporting the hypothesis that increased synthesis of surfactin in the undomesticated signal-deficient mutant exerts a negative fitness effect (Fig. 3D).;  No ComX-dependent negative fitness effect was observed in the absence of the ComP receptor, confirming that the srfA expression in the signal-deficient mutant was induced by a specific ComX–ComP interaction and that overproduction of surfactin is responsible for the negative fitness effect in monoculture (Fig.;  Therefore, the negative fitness associated with high production of surfactin might be associated with metabolic overinvestment of the mutant in the stationary phase and possibly decreased investment in primary, growth-supporting metabolism.; On the basis of the results described above we hypothesized that the signal-deficient mutant PS216∆comQ will fail in competition with the QS wild-type PS216, because it would suffer from negative fitness effects when facing the QS signal produced by the wild type.;  We next examined the fitness of the double-mutant PS216∆comQ∆srfA that did not show fitness loss when exposed to ComX in monoculture (Fig. 3C) and surprisingly we discovered that it was also outcompeted by the wild type, comprising less than 10% (P < 0.001) of the community after incubation for 8 h (Fig. 4B).;  PS216∆srfA did not show any changes in fitness against parental strains with the intact srfA gene (Fig.;  This suggests that surfactin, produced by the wild type or added to the coculture predominantly indirectly contributes to fitness loss of the double mutant and that the presence of the QS-proficient population is required to observe a strong negative fitness effect on the signal-deficient double mutant (PS216∆comQ∆srfA).;  However, surfactin itself also shows a minor direct negative effect on the double mutant during stationary phase, which may at least in part account for the difference in fitness during competition between the surfactin producer and the double mutant.; The question that remains is whether the fitness loss of the signal-deficient mutant PS216∆comQ is linked to surfactin overproduction, observed in monocultures grown in the presence of exogenous ComX.;  We believe this mechanism does contribute to the fitness loss of PS216∆comQ when challenged with QS-proficient populations.;  This is consistent with the hypothesis that surfactin overproduction adds to fitness loss of the signaling mutant.;  Therefore, two surfactin-dependent mechanisms may exist: a direct mechanism related to surfactin overproduction and an indirect mechanism when the competitor produces surfactin, reducing the fitness of the signaling mutant through an as-yet-unknown mechanism.;  The size of the cell indicates the relative fitness loss of the population. (A) Signal-deficient mutant QSS− facing the QS signal ComX secreted by QS+A− suffers from fitness loss associated with overproduction of surfactin. (B) The signal-deficient surfactin-deficient double-mutant QSS−A−, which does not overproduce surfactin, is released from the ComX-mediated fitness loss when competed with the signal-producing-but-surfactin-deficient QS+A− strain. (C) Signal-deficient mutant suffers from fitness loss when cocultured with the QS+ strain due to a ComX-mediated mechanism and possibly due to another mechanism that depends on surfactin. (D) The surfactin-dependent mechanism leads to the fitness loss of the QSS−A− double mutant when it is cocultured with the surfactin-producing QS+ strain.;  Bimodal expression of srfA in undomesticated strains was reported previously (19) and was suggested to lead to phenotypic differentiation of the Bacillus population and a division of labor that provide fitness benefits (25).;  Recently it was reported that in Salmonella, which shows bimodal expression of virulence, the existence of an avirulent subpopulation is essential for the fitness and evolutionary stability of virulence (26).;  In fact, under our experimental conditions, synthesis of surfactin was not charged with any obvious fitness costs as the growth of the QS+ wild type was very similar to that of the signaling mutant when no exogenous signal was added.;  However, this changed dramatically when signal was added to the comQ mutant, decreasing the fitness of the mutant.;  Therefore, generating a higher proportion of surfactin producers may have significantly contributed to the fitness loss of the mutant.;  Another mechanism that may decrease the fitness cost is related to prudent regulation of public goods in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (27).;  Production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant is limited to the stationary phase and thus free of fitness charges, but release of biosurfactant production from QS control (using an inducible promoter for its induction) resulted in its imprudent production and fitness loss (27).; Moreover our results show that surfactin itself, when produced by the competitor, is indirectly involved in the fitness loss of the signaling mutant.;  We found that the fitness loss of the signal-deficient mutant is due to the metabolic burden linked to production of a secondary metabolite, surfactin, rather than due to the autotoxicity of surfactin.;  Finally, fitness loss of the signal-deficient mutant is caused by the second, surfactin-linked mechanism that acts even in the absence of metabolic constraint."
fitness,D012640,25182327,4173789," To understand the contribution of distinct regulators to B728a fitness and pathogenicity, we performed a transcriptome analysis of strain B728a and nine regulatory mutants recovered from the surfaces and interior of leaves and exposed to environmental stresses in culture.;  Despite knowledge of individual regulators that affect the fitness or pathogenicity of foliar pathogens, our understanding of the relative importance of various global regulators to leaf colonization is limited.;  Among the remaining ECF-σ factors, several are involved in responding to iron limitation (16, 17), but only AlgU, also known as AlgT, has been shown to contribute to P. syringae fitness on leaves (18).;  Like AlgU, the sigma factor RpoS has a role in bacterial stress tolerance, including in pseudomonads (21), although its role in the stress tolerance and in planta fitness of strain B728a has not been examined.;  Loss of 3-oxo-C6-HSL synthesis was associated with reduced epiphytic fitness as well as reduced alginate production and increased swarming in culture (26, 27).;  MexAB-OprM in strain B728a is known to contribute to fitness on leaves and tolerance to antibacterial compounds (37).;  Collectively, our results support the possibility of a negative regulatory element involved in T3SS regulation, and for HrpL activation of some T3SS genes on leaf surfaces, which is a trait that may be unique to B728a and contribute to its uniquely robust epiphytic fitness (15)."
fitness,D012640,27491886,5123934," These gene collectives are highly evolved for horizontal exchange, thus providing immediate opportunities to test the effects of small molecules on fitness.;  They generally confer fitness advantages and are not considered essential for growth or reproduction.;  Thus, BGCs can be studied in the context of mobile genetic elements, and as such considered independent evolutionary entities relative to the hosts in which they occur [20]. Once acquired, they provide immediate opportunities for a new host to test the effects of the small molecules they encode on fitness (Figure 1, Key Figure).;  The acquisition of a BGC by HGT shares similarities with a nucleotide substitution, except that an acquisition event provides the opportunity to test the fitness effects of a small molecule encoded by a large and complex gene cluster as opposed to an amino acid change in a protein.;  These types of cooperative behaviors are challenging to interpret from an evolutionary perspective as they create opportunities for social cheating, where non-producers benefit from compounds without paying the cost of production [63]. Natural product social cheating has been observed among bacteria that produce quorum sensing compounds [64] and iron-chelating siderophores [65]. One evolutionary theory used to explain natural products as public goods despite the potential for cheating is kin selection [66], where traits are favored because of their beneficial effects on the fitness of relatives."

gastrointestinal tract cancers,D004067,29113654,5726560," Consistent with these lines of evidence, clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown associations of specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis with gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.;  A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.; Cancer in the gastrointestinal tract is a leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Accumulating evidence indicates that gastrointestinal tract cancers develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations, which are influenced by host immunity, diet, and environmental and microbial exposures [2].; Here, we review clinical studies on intestinal bacteria in relation to gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.; These clinical studies have linked specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis to gastrointestinal tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers.; Surgery for gastrointestinal tract cancers and intestinal reconstructions has been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota.; Postoperative complications have been associated with tumor recurrence and a worse patient survival in gastrointestinal tract cancers [160–165]. Manipulating the gut microbiota by diet, lifestyle, antibiotics, and probiotics and prebiotics might become useful towards preventing the occurrence of postoperative complications and improving postoperative recovery after gastrointestinal tract surgery.;  The liver is exposed to the gut microbiome via blood from the portal vein and hepatic artery and has many immune cell types, including T cells and macrophages [166]. Colorectal cancer patients with high-level T-cell infiltration in liver metastasis tissues exhibit high sensitivity to anticancer agents and have good prognosis [167]. Furthermore, emerging data have shown that there is a higher amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum in liver metastatic lesions from colorectal cancer compared with non-cancerous liver tissue [45]. Hence, intestinal bacteria might inhibit the anticancer immune response, and contribute to the formation of liver metastases from gastrointestinal tract cancers.;  Hence, interdisciplinary research in relation to oncology, microbiology, immunology, gastroenterology, pathology, and surgical oncology would provide valuable data for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the gut microbiome.;  A better understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota in the process of absorption after gastrointestinal reconstruction and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery may provide new opportunities to utilize the gut microbiota for postoperative recovery in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers."
gastrointestinal tract neoplasms,D004067,29113654,5726560," Accumulating evidence demonstrates that specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract can potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms by damaging DNA, activating oncogenic signaling pathways, producing tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, and suppressing antitumor immunity.; The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms, which can influence the immune system and health conditions, including cancer [3–5]. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet, lifestyle, and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [6,7]. Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [8,9]."

heat shock proteins,D012769,28003198,5311399," While many putative grazer deterrence genes (encoding microcystin, aeruginosin, cyanopeptolin, and microviridin) were largely unaffected by zooplankton, transcripts for heat shock proteins (hsp) increased in abundance.;  With regard to stress response genes, there were 11 genes encoding heat shock proteins that had increasing transcript abundances in 200 D. pulex liter−1 and 120 D. magna liter−1 treatments, as well as clpB, which is involved in translation and encodes a stress-induced multichaperone system (Fig. 6; see also Fig.;  Strong and significant differential expression of gene sets associated with stress (such as heat shock proteins), photosynthesis, and gas vesicle production was also observed.;  Given that transcripts of these microcystin tailoring and transport genes (mcyHIJ) also increase under limited nitrogen conditions (30), these collective findings suggest that the modification and movement of the microcystin molecule may be a stress response, perhaps supporting the hypothesis that microcystin plays a role as an antioxidant (36, 40), given the concurrent response of multiple stress response genes in these same treatments (e.g., heat shock proteins).;  In contrast, intense direct grazing elicited a broader and deeper transcriptional response from Microcystis, with large increases in transcripts for photosynthesis genes, gas vesicle genes, and heat shock proteins.;  In Microcystis, it was observed that the heat shock protein genes hspA and htpG are responsive to temperature (53), while the abundances of transcripts for these and other heat shock proteins (dnaJ, dnaK, and grpE) increase under nitrogen and phosphorus limitation (29, 30).;  Consistent with this hypothesis, the responses of these heat shock proteins may also be related to nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), a mechanism employed by plants and numerous phytoplankton (including cyanobacteria) to dissipate excess excitation energy as heat (56).;  Again, given that microcystin may serve as an antioxidant, (36, 40), its modification and intracellular movement, as evidenced by the increasing transcript abundance of mcyHIJ, is consistent with the responses of heat shock proteins.;  Alternatively, given that heat shock proteins have also been implicated in maintaining cellular membranes (57), their transcription might be a repair response by cells exposed to “sloppy feeding” by the daphnids (58), especially if they were of an enzymatic nature and involved in membrane repair.;  Given the known diversity of heat shock proteins (52, 53) and the large number of genes encoding such proteins present in Microcystis, it is possible that different heat shock proteins were serving different functions when upregulated in response to grazers during this study."
hemolysis,D006461,25897029,4518835," EepR and the putative sensor kinase EepS were necessary for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including prodigiosin- and serratamolide-dependent phenotypes, swarming motility, and hemolysis.;  Using a genetic approach, suppressor mutations of the hyperhemolysis and pigment phenotypes of the crp mutant strain were generated and mapped to an uncharacterized putative two-component transcriptional regulator locus.;  These were performed on blood agar plates to screen for pigment- and hemolysis-defective mutants as described below.;  The mutants with reduced or eliminated prodigiosin then were screened for hyperhemolysis suppression phenotypes; an example is shown in Fig. 1A.;  A progidiosin-defective mutant with an insertion in the pigB pigment biosynthetic gene was included to demonstrate a strain defective in the pigment phenotype is not necessary for the hemolysis phenotypes (Fig. 1A).; Hyperhemolysis phenotype of crp mutants and genetic analysis. (A) Photograph demonstrating suppression of the crp hemolysis (left) and pigment (right) phenotypes by mutation of eepR and eepS.; Other transposon-based genetic screens that provided impetus to analyze these two ORFs included the following: (i) a mutation in SMDB11_3959 eliminated production of an antistaphylococcal compound produced by S. marcescens (15), (ii) multiple mutations of SMDB11_3958 eliminated secreted hemolysis activity by a clinical isolate, K904, and (iii) a mutation upstream of SMDB11_3959 eliminated protease secretion by a nonpigmented ocular clinical isolate, K949 (data not shown).;  Altogether, 12 independent mutations in SMDB11_3958 and SMDB11_3959 have been identified, and all of these mutant strains were found to be deficient in hemolysis (serratamolide) and, if the strain was pigmented, defective in prodigiosin production.; Mutation of crp in CMS376 results in higher levels of hemolysis than that of the isogenic parental strain due to increased production of the biosurfactant serratamolide (23), also known as serrawettin W1 (41).;  Since EepR/S appears to function with CRP in a regulatory pathway that controls prodigiosin production and EepR and EepS are required for the hemolysis phenotype of crp mutants (Fig. 1B), we tested whether EepR played a role in serratamolide production.;  Mutation of eepR and eepS in other isolates, such as K904 and Nima, eliminated hemolysis as measured from clearing zones on blood agar plates (Fig. 5A and data not shown).;  Expression of the serratamolide biosynthetic gene, swrW, from a multicopy plasmid restored swarming motility and hemolysis to tested eepR and eepS mutants (Fig. 5C and data not shown), suggesting that a loss of swrW expression was the mechanism underlying the eepR hemolysis and swarming defects.;  These two genes have an important impact on a variety of processes by S. marcescens, including motility, hemolysis, and production of antimicrobial compounds that likely play a role in bacterium-bacterium interactions and successful colonization of environmental niches."
hemolytic phospholipase C,C537418,23457628,3572970," In P. aeruginosa, choline is oxidized to glycine betaine which can be used as an osmoprotectant, a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, and as an inducer of the virulence factor, hemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH) via the transcriptional regulator GbdR.; Unlike the enterics, many common soil and water-dwelling bacteria can aerobically catabolize choline as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy [15]. In P. aeruginosa, choline is oxidized to GB followed by sequential demethylation to dimethylglycine, sarcosine, and glycine [16], [17]. P. aeruginosa, like other soil-dwelling Proteobacteria, maintains intracellular GB pools that persist during growth on choline and GB, even in the absence of osmotic stress [17], [18], [19], and P. aeruginosa can also maintain an intracellular choline pool [19]. The intracellular pools of both choline and GB are regulated in P. aeruginosa, and depletion of either pool alters both growth under osmostress conditions and production of the secreted hemolytic phospholipase C, PlcH [19]. PlcH has been shown to have a role in virulence and bacterial survival in a number of models, including the mouse lung [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. GB induces the expression of PlcH via the transcription factor GbdR [27], and GbdR regulates the genes involved in GB catabolism [16], directly linking regulation of a secreted virulence factor with metabolism of the host.;  These two lipids are abundant components of pulmonary surfactant and the outer leaflet of the host cell membranes [10], [11], [32], and are substrates of the hemolytic phospholipase C, PlcH, a known P. aeruginosa virulence factor [33], [34]. PlcH hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin generates phosphorylcholine in addition to the respective lipid backbones."

human diseases,D015658,22545867,3420326," Screening of products derived from these bacteria has revealed a puzzling amount of hits against infectious and non-infectious human diseases.; Natural products from plants and microbes have played a pivotal role in drug discovery for more than a century [1-3]. In recent years, myxobacteria have matched fungi, actinomycetes as well as some species of the genus Bacillus as top producers of microbial secondary metabolites [4-6]. More importantly, screening campaigns have revealed a large proportion of the myxobacteria secondary metabolism to have activities against human diseases such as cancer, bacterial and viral infections [6-8].; The amount of different small molecules from myxobacteria targeting other soil bacteria and fungi, around 29% and 54% respectively, and their higher production rates during exponential growth seems to reinforce the idea of a broad use of secondary metabolites for hunting [13,17]. Any predatory microorganism would benefit greatly from such a diverse armament but why would a large amount of these metabolites be active against human diseases and pathogens? An attractive explanation is that many of these products target shared processes or structural features conserved throughout evolution [24-26]. For example, the LSm1-7 protein complex in mammalian cells was shown to be required for efficient hepatitis C virus (HCV) translation and replication [25]. The Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plant virus that can replicate in yeast, utilizes the respective yeast homologues for the same processes [27-29]. Likewise, the bacteriophage Q, a plus-strand RNA virus as HCV and BMV, requires Hfq, the homologue of LSm1 in bacteria for its expansion [30]. Thus there is a functional conservation of cellular and viral regulatory elements across kingdoms and virus groups that may be exploited for antiviral drug development."

Similarly, medicinal plants have been used since prehistory to treat human diseases or to improve human health and today plant drug discovery remains extremely important for the pharmaceutical industry [16,17]. Recently, non-pathogenic actinomycetes, living inside plant tissues as endophytes, are being screened for the production of bioactive compounds [18,19].

hypoxia,D000860,28205416,5481476," We investigated the effects of hypoxia on secondary metabolite production and observed a shift away from the antibiotic napyradiomycin towards 8-amino-flaviolin, an intermediate in the napyradiomycin biosynthetic pathway.;  It has further been proposed that the induction of Nar3 synthesis in response to oxygen limitation may facilitate the use of nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor in streptomycetes (Falke et al., 2016), however the mechanisms by which vegetative mycelia survive hypoxia remain poorly understood (Van Keulen et al., 2007).;  Thus, it is realistic to expect that bacteria in these habitats will experience periodic hypoxia events.;  If these functions include adaptations to hypoxia, it could provide the mechanism by which streptomycetes survive in the absence of oxygen.; This is the first investigation into the effects of hypoxia on secondary metabolism in bacteria that inhabit marine sediments."

infected,D007239,23771021,3709798," Therefore, non-targeted metabolomic analysis of aqueous and chloroform extracts of leafy gall and non-infected tobacco was carried out by 1H-NMR coupled to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).;  Analysis of crude extracts of leafy galls and non-infected tobacco leaves exhibited a distinct antiproliferative activity against all four tested human cancer cell lines.;  This leads to cell reprogramming [11,12], resulting in the development of the so-called leafy galls on a wide range of host plants [8]. At the early stage of leafy gall development, both primary and secondary metabolisms are modified to contribute to symptoms development [12]. However, the metabolic changes characterizing the fully developed leafy gall, which is the ecological niche of the R. fascians, remain largely unexplored, except for the identification of 7-methyl-esculin, a phenolic compound accumulated in tobacco symptomatic tissues, but not in non-infected tissues [13].; Here, the monitoring of the metabolic status was investigated by NMR and antiproliferative activity by MTT assay, comparing polar and non-polar extracts between well-developed leafy galls and non-infected tobacco tissues.;  Figure 1 illustrates the phenotype of the non-infected (NI) tobacco plants 11 weeks post germination and a typical eight-week-old LG, a morphological structure with multiple dormant buds and malformed leaves characterized by increased trichomes formations.; The morphological features of leafy gall (LG) formed in Rhodococcus fascians-infected tobacco plant (eight weeks post infection) and non-infected (NI) tobacco plant grown for 12 weeks.;  The in vitro tobacco plants were infected four weeks post germination.;  These data suggest an alteration in biosynthetic pathways leading to the accumulation of terpenoids and/or fatty compounds to the detriment of the metabolites diversity in infected tobacco cells.;  In contrast, a visual observation of the 1H-NMR spectra of polar metabolites (aqueous extracts) revealed no obvious differences in chemical shifts between R. fascians infected (LG) and non-infected (NI) tobacco plants (Figure 3).; The typical 1H-NMR spectra (300.13 MHz) of polar tobacco metabolites from NI and LG infected tissues.;  These PCA scores were tested by a one-way-ANOVA (Table 1), indicating significant differences between R. fascians-infected and non-infected tobacco metabolites profiles (p < 0.001).;  According to the mapping metabolite approach described by Graham [22], the PC1 component allows an obvious discrimination between extracts of R. fascians-infected and non-infected tobacco plants.;  To further support this assumption, qualitative GC-MS analysis of chloroformic extracts from both LG and non-infected plants was investigated.;  It is therefore tempting to postulate that, diterpene biosynthetic pathway and particularly cembrenoids family is stimulated in infected tobacco tissue.;  The discrimination between infected and non-infected tobacco plant extracts mainly takes place in the aliphatic region, at δ 0.7–3.0 ppm, and in the olefinic region, at δ 5.0–5.5 ppm.; The one-way ANOVA analysis of Rhodococcus. fascians infected and non-infected tobacco extracts PCA scores based on 1H-NMR signals changes.;  This confirms a previous observation by transcriptomic and BiNGO (Biological Network Gene Ontology) analysis of up-regulated genes in R. fascians infected-Arabidopsis that revealed an up-regulation of the plant host diterpenoid pathway [12]. To date, the role of terpenoid compounds in the R. fascians-plant interactions remains unknown, although some tobacco-pathogen interactions are known for leading to alterations in the terpenes pathway.;  PCA scores were tested by a one-way-ANOVA (Table 1), indicating non-significant difference between R. fascians-infected and non-infected tobacco metabolites profiles (p > 0.05).;  The discrimination between infected and non-infected tobacco plant extracts mainly takes place at δ 2–5.5 ppm.; The orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminating analysis (OPLS-DA) of 1H-NMR spectra for aqueous extracts of both NI and Rhodococcus fascians-infected LG tobacco tissues; (a) The predictive component (Cp, X-axis) explains 46.1% and the first orthogonal component (Co1, Y-axis) 19.4% of the dataset variation; (b) The X axis (p) describes the loadings of each variable and Y-axis (p(corr)) represents the reliability of each variable in the dataset.; The VIP (variable importance in the projections) values of the major metabolites change in Rhodococcus fascians-infected tobacco (LG) contributing for the separation in the OPLS-DA score plots.;  Four week-old plants were injured and infected at the apical bud with 10 μL of R. fascians virulent cultures strain D188 according to Rajaonson et al [39]. The leafy galls (LG) that formed were harvested eight weeks after infection.;  Non-infected (NI) tobacco plants were harvested after twelve weeks of growth (at the same developmental stage as the infected plants).; Fifteen (for chloroform extraction) and nine (for aqueous extraction) independent samples, of infected and non-infected plants were randomly constituted by mixing material harvested from plants.;  OPLS-DA was carried out between R. fascians-infected and non-infected tobacco plants to identify metabolites affected by infection.;  All together these study support the occurrence of dramatic metabolic changes in R. fascians infected tissues that remain largely unexplored and therefore incite us to better explore LG as a resource for new compounds with promising potential for drug development."

infected,D007239,23586643,3635983," We analyzed global changes in gene expression of CaLam-infected leaves of sweet orange during the symptomatic stage of infection and compared the results with previously published microarray studies that used CaLas-infected plants.;  Twenty candidate genes were selected to validate the expression profiles in symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-positive leaves infected with CaLas or CaLam.;  Real time PCR of 20 candidate genes validated the expression pattern of some genes in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves infected with CaLam or CaLas.;  Both CaLas and CaLam are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri); however, they can also be transmitted with different levels of efficiency by grafting of infected tissues [3,4].; Once a citrus tree is infected, the time taken for HLB symptoms to appear varies according to the genotype; the physiological stage and age of the plant; the tissue used as the source of bacteria or the intensity of inoculation by the psyllid; and the season of the year.;  Small, poor quality and lopsided fruits are frequently observed [5]. There is a clear disturbance of the transport system between source (leaves) and sinks (meristems, fruits, roots), with starch accumulation in plastids, chloroplast disruption, necrotic phloem (probably associated with plugging of sieve cells via callose deposition) and phloem-proteins accumulation [6-8]. Ultrastructural changes in the phloem and adjacent tissues can be observed in plants infected with CaLas, from the early (asymptomatic) stages of infection (three months), progressing to phloem degeneration nine months later [8]. However, before the complete degeneration of the phloem vessels, the bacteria move to newly growing tissues to restart the infection process [8]. Compared with CaLas, CaLam is less effectively transmitted both by vector and by grafting, is more sensitive to higher temperatures and reaches lower titer levels under the same experimental conditions.;  The other prophage, SC2, is apparently in the lysogenic phase both in plants and psyllid infected by CaLas.;  A set of candidate genes from this and from previous studies was used to validate the expression profile in symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-positive leaf tissue of sweet orange infected with CaLas or CaLam.; Pera sweet orange plants were grafted with two CaLam-infected buds and the bacterium was first detected by PCR only 56 weeks after grafting (wag).;  Hamlin sweet orange grafted either with two CaLam- or CaLas-infected buds were PCR positive at 64 and 32 wag, respectively.; Microarray analysis identified 633 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam: 418 of them (66%) were upregulated and 215 (34%) were downregulated (p-values ≤0.05, fold change |FC| ≥ 2.0 and odds probability ≥ 0.95).;  Notably, the glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate transporter 2 (GPT2) was the most strongly regulated transcript in CaLam symptomatic, infected leaves.;  Moreover, a transcript encoding a cytochrome P450 (CYP83B1), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and defense response by callose deposition, was also upregulated in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam [22].; Subset of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leaves of symptomatic sweet orange plants infected with CaLam compared with non-infected plants;  Two gene transcripts (SABP3 and USP) showed a non-statistically significant trend for differential modulation in symptomatic or asymptomatic leaves (both infected with CaLam or CaLas) in relation to the control, according to the RT-qPCR assays (Additional file 5).; Comparison of the expression levels of a subset of ten genes in symptomatic (SY) and asymptomatic (AS) leaves of Hamlin sweet orange infected with CaLas or CaLam in relation to their controls (H) by RT-qPCR.;  In the asymptomatic leaves infected with CaLam, the expression of two genes (auxin efflux carrier and VTE2) were induced and repressed, respectively, compared with the control (Additional file 5).;  The phloem-protein B15 (PP2-B15), which is reported as one of the most upregulated genes in response to CaLas [6,16,17], also showed a progressive increase in expression in asymptomatic and symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam.;  CaLas and CaLam are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid and are restricted to the phloem of infected citrus, where they can multiply and spread, causing a severe imbalance in the translocation of nutrients and other important metabolites.;  Phloem is the main trafficking pathway of nutrients, defensive compounds and signaling molecules throughout the plant; thus, several relevant biological processes are affected in citrus infected with Liberibacters.;  High levels of ZIP1 transcripts (FC = 30.48) were also observed in the transcriptome of ‘Navel’ and ‘Madam Vinous’ sweet oranges infected with CaLas, although ZIP1 was not found among the proteins evaluated in the citrus proteome [19]. Similarly, transcripts for a ZIP5 transporter were highly induced in the infected susceptible genotype (Cleopatra mandarin) but not in the tolerant genotype (US-897) [17]. The overexpression of transcripts for Zn transporters in citrus in the late stages of infection with CaLam or CaLas are expected, because the symptoms in the leaves of susceptible citrus plants often resemble those of zinc deficiency.;  In fact, in some citrus genotypes, the concentrations of Zn and Fe in infected plants was found to be approximately half those in healthy plants, which indicates that zinc homoeostasis is significantly affected during infection [24]. As an important micronutrient in plants, zinc has structural (e.g., carbonic anhydrase) and catalytic functions (e.g., superoxide dismutase CuZn-SOD) in many of enzymes.;  As a result, several studies demonstrated that an imbalance in the intracellular zinc concentration affects not only optimal plant growth, but also, in some cases, the susceptibility/tolerance of plants to certain pathogens [25,26]. In susceptible citrus infected with Liberibacters, zinc deficiency has, to some extent, been associated with inefficient translocation of this mineral by the roots.; In addition to nutritional deficiencies observed during symptom progression of HLB, several studies reported that CaLas infection dramatically affects carbohydrate metabolism [8,17]. The imbalance of carbohydrate partitioning causes an accumulation of starch in infected leaves during the progression of HLB symptoms.;  Evidence for this observation include increases in the starch content in symptomatic leaves, microscopic observations of starch accumulation in phloem parenchyma cells of infected leaves, induction of transcripts encoding enzymes related to starch biosynthesis (such as ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase)) and repression of transcripts related to starch breakdown [6,16,17,19]. Similarly to CaLas infected leaves, we found an induction of transcripts encoding key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis and repression of those related to starch breakdown in CaLam infected leaves.;  Real time PCR of the starch synthase gene confirmed its upregulation in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam and showed increased expression from asymptomatic to symptomatic leaves (Figure 3).;  High levels of sucrose and glucose in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLas have also been documented [16,19]. The increase in glucose levels explains the significant induction of transcripts for glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate transporter 2 (GPT2) in the transcriptome of citrus leaves infected with CaLas [17]. In our microarray analysis, GPT2 was also significantly induced in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam compared with the control.;  RT-qPCR analysis showed a significantly increased expression of transcripts for GPT2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves infected with both CaLas and CaLam (Figure 3).;  Among them, a galactinol synthase (GLS8) increased by seven-fold in infected plants.;  High intracellular levels of RFOs have been correlated with osmoprotection in plant cells; however, recent studies reported RFOs as potential scavengers of ROS, suggesting a novel role for RFOs in protection against oxidative stress [28]. We hypothesized that the induction of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of RFOs may be an attempt to reduce the level of sucrose in the phloem of infected leaves, although this strategy does not appear to be effective in preventing the accumulation of starch in leaves and the subsequent consequences on the translocation of nutrients from source to sink organs.;  The knockout of UGT76B1 in Arabidopsis led to enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae, but an increased susceptibility to Alternaria brassicicola[29]. In HLB-infected citrus trees, transcripts encoding different UGTs were modulated in leaves [17] and in fruit tissues infected with CaLas [18]. Among them, transcripts encoding a UGT73B3 were more abundant in infected leaves of the tolerant hybrid compared with Cleopatra, the susceptible citrus genotype.;  Unlike UGT76B1, knockout of UGT73B3 and its homolog UGT73B5 in Arabidopsis led to increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae[30]. The modulation of several UGTs either in CaLam or CaLas infected plants reveals the potential application of UGTs as target genes for genetic engineering.;  Several transcriptome studies of citrus infected with CaLas have reported a strong induction of transcripts encoding the phloem protein PP2-B15 in symptomatic leaves of sweet oranges compared with the control [6,16,17]. In our microarray analysis, we found transcripts encoding two different phloem proteins, PP2-B10, which was highly induced and PP2-B14, which was moderately induced.;  We tested the expression of PP2-B10 by RT-qPCR and confirmed an increase in the level of this transcript in asymptomatic and symptomatic CaLam infected leaves compared with control leaves (Figure 3).;  PP2-B15 was also assayed by RT-qPCR and showed a similar pattern of overexpression found to PP2-B10 in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves infected with CaLam.;  Microarray analysis identified transcripts for 38 TFs that were differentially expressed in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam.;  The most highly induced TF was a myb-like gene, which regulates the expression of several genes in response to phosphate during sucrose starvation in Arabidopsis[34,35]. In addition to having regulatory roles in the defense response upon infection with different pathogens [36-38], several MYB genes have been reported as key regulators of sugar-responsive genes, such as α-amylase during sugar starvation in rice [39]. Interestingly, the same myb-like gene was nearly 200-fold induced in symptomatic leaves of susceptible plants infected with CaLas, but not in the tolerant genotype, indicating that the upregulation of this gene could be associated with the susceptibility of citrus to Ca.; Among the differentially expressed defense-related gene transcripts in CaLam-infected citrus leaves were several for receptor-like proteins and a LysM receptor-like kinase (CERK1).;  Although the differential expression of transcripts encoding a CERK1 could not be confirmed by RT-qPCR in CaLam infected leaves, this gene was induced in asymptomatic leaves infected with CaLas.;  One of the first studies of the transcriptome of citrus leaves infected with CaLas reported an induction of PR6 only in asymptomatic leaves collected 5–9 weeks after inoculation [6]. In that paper, PR6 was annotated as a putative protease inhibitor (At2g38870).;  RT-qPCR showed a slight induction in the expression of this gene only in symptomatic leaves infected with CaLam.;  SABP3 has a high affinity for SA and its downregulation has been detected in CaLas infected leaves of citrus [6]. In addition, Slaymaker (2002) showed that in tobacco, SABP3 has antioxidant properties and has a role in the hypersensitive response [46]. Similarly, transcripts for CA2 were also reported to decrease significantly in leaves of Arabidopsis 12 hours post-inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae[47], which leads us to speculate that the downregulation of these genes could be associated with susceptibility of citrus to Liberibacters.;  Among them were transcripts for CSD1 and CSD2, which were induced and repressed, respectively, in symptomatic leaves infected by CaLam.;  Firstly, plants were graft-inoculated using two buds from CaLam-infected Pera sweet orange trees kept in the greenhouse conditions and used as source of inoculum.;  Plants were inoculated again with one infected bud 32 weeks after the first grafting because of the low efficiency of grafting transmission of CaLam and the delay in bacterium detection and symptoms manifestation.;  To compare the differential expression of selected genes in response to the infection with different Liberibacter species, four-month-old shoot-tip grafted (virus-free) plants of Hamlin sweet orange were grafted with two buds from CaLam or CaLas infected sweet orange trees kept in the greenhouse conditions and used as source of inoculum.;  Once detected, the potentially relevant processes revealed in our analysis were compared to those described in the previously published microarray analysis of citrus infected with CaLas [6,16,17,19]. Although the microarray platforms (Roche Nimblegen versus Affymetrix GeneChip® Citrus Genome Array), chip densities, and EST enrichment libraries used were not the same, we assume that the response detected by different experiments would be similar or even complementary and could thus help us to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the infection of citrus by Ca.;  Seven of them were also reported as differentially expressed in CaLas infected leaves of citrus [17]: an oxidorreductase, a kunitz family protein, miraculin-like protein, glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate transporter 2 (GPT2), a chloroplastic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CSD2), a beta-carbonic anhydrase (SABP3) and the transcription factor WRKY70.; Comparison of the expression levels of ten genes in symptomatic (SY) and asymptomatic (ASY) leaves infected with CaLas or CaLam in relation to their controls (H) by RT-qPCR."
infected,D007239,27760211,5070912," We demonstrated production of paenilarvins in infected larvae.;  Accordingly, exposure bioassays performed with larvae infected by wild-type P. larvae and a knockout mutant of P. larvae lacking production of paenilarvins did not substantiate a role for the paenilarvins as virulence factor.;  Early larval stages up to the age of 36 hours after egg hatching are most susceptible and become infected upon the oral uptake of P. larvae spores which are the only infectious form of this pathogen [1]. In the larval midgut, the spores germinate and the vegetative life cycle of P. larvae begins.;  Repetitive element PCR (repPCR) performed with so-called ERIC-primers amplifying enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequences led to the identification of four different genotypes of P. larvae, ERIC I to IV, which were shown to differ in virulence: Depending on the ERIC genotype, infected larvae succumb to the disease within about seven (ERIC II-IV) or twelve (ERIC I) days post infection [8–10].;  To experimentally address the biological role of paenilarvins during the infection process, first we confirmed the presence of paenilarvins in larvae experimentally infected with spores of the P. larvae ERIC II reference strain DSM25430 [15]. The paenilarvins were successfully detected in larval homogenates via high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) analyses demonstrating that they are indeed synthesized also during experimental infection (Table 1, Fig 1A).;  Confirmation of paenilarvin synthesis in experimentally infected larvae was a prerequisite for analyzing the role of the paenilarvins during pathogenesis via exposure bioassays performed with a gene inactivation mutant of P. larvae ERIC II, DSM25430 Δitu, which did no longer produce the paenilarvins, and the corresponding wild-type strain, DSM25430 wt, expressing the paenilarvins (Fig 1B and 1C).;  The measured masses of the paenilarvins from infected larvae and cultured bacteria were identical (Table 1, Fig 1C).; (A) Extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) for paenilarvins detected in experimentally infected bee larvae.; Wild-type and mutant bacteria were tested in parallel in exposure bioassays and total as well as cumulative mortality of infected larvae was determined.;  In the groups infected with wild-type P. larvae, 84.33% ± 8.08% (Fig 2A) died within eight days (Fig 2B) while the mutant bacteria killed 83.33% ± 8.51% (Fig 2A) also within eight days (Fig 2B).;  Hence, no significant differences in larval mortality between the groups infected with wild-type DSM25430 wt or mutant DSM25430 Δitu could be detected for total (Fig 2A; Student’s t-test, p-value = 0.89) or for cumulative (Fig 2; two-way ANOVA, p-value = 0.15) mortality suggesting that paenilarvins did not act as virulence factors of P. larvae ERIC II in exposure bioassays.; (A) At the age of 12 hours after egg hatching, honey bee larvae were infected with P. larvae DSM25430 wt and DSM25430 Δitu.;  Neither total mortality of larvae (Fig 2A) nor disease progression in larvae (Fig 2B) was significantly altered when larvae were infected with the paenilarvin deficient strain compared to the lethality of the wild-type bacteria.; To confirm the presence of paenilarvins in experimentally infected larvae, laboratory infection assays (exposure bioassays) were performed essentially as described [8,9,29]. Briefly, first instar honey bee larvae were grafted into wells of 24-well-plates already containing normal (control groups) artificial larval diet (66% royal jelly (v/v), 33% glucose (w/v) and 33% fructose (w/v)) or larval diet contaminated with spores of DSM25430 at a concentration of 500 colony forming units (cfu)/mL larval diet, which was determined in prior experiments to correspond to the LC80 (lethal concentration) of this strain."
infected,D007239,25044543,4234257," Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death.;  All genotypes share the general steps in pathogenesis: Honey bee larvae become infected by ingesting spores, which germinate in the midgut; vegetative P. larvae then massively proliferate in the midgut, breach the peritrophic membrane and the epithelium, and finally decompose the larva to a ropy mass (Yue et al. 2008; Garcia-Gonzalez and Genersch 2013).;  Larvae of first instar were infected with P. larvae ERIC II wild-type (DSM25430) and the Pam deficient knock-out mutant (DSM25430 ΔpamA) by adding corresponding spores in a final concentration of 500 cfu/mL (about LC100) to the larval diet to ensure that infection of larvae was initiated by the same number of vegetative P. larvae for wild-type and knock-out bacteria.;  Only larvae that died of AFB infected by P. larvae ERIC II (DSM25430 wt) or by the Pam-deficient knock-out (DSM25430 ΔpamA) mutant, respectively, were considered for statistical calculations.;  Surprisingly, total mortality did not differ significantly between the groups infected with wild-type or mutant bacteria (Fig.​(Fig.7A).7A).; Role of paenilamicin during infection of honey bee larvae. (A) First instar honey bee larvae were infected with P. larvae DSM25430 wt and DSM25430 ΔpamA.;  Larvae infected with DSM25430 ΔpamA died as fast as larvae that had been infected with wild-type bacteria, however, onset of larval dying was delayed resulting in a significant parallel shift of the cumulative mortality curve to the right.; Analyzing the time course of infection revealed that the curve for cumulative mortality was shifted to the right for the groups infected with the mutant strain (Fig.​(Fig.7B)7B) indicating that in these groups the onset of larval dying was significantly delayed in comparison to the groups infected with wild-type bacteria (P = 0.028; two-way ANOVA).;  The wild-type strain DSM25430 needed 8.33 ± 1.52 days to kill all infected larvae, whereas it took the mutant strain DSM25430 ΔpamA 12.0 ± 0 days to accomplish killing all infected animals.;  Instead, absence or presence of Pam production did not make a difference in total mortality but instead a delay in the onset of larval dying was observed in those larvae that were infected with the mutant bacteria.;  Both, germination and growth of the mutant strain were not negatively influenced in cultured P. larvae when compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 1) and all larvae were infected with the same concentration of CFUs, hence, with the same concentration of germinating spores.;  However, in larvae infected by P. larvae lacking Pam production a delayed onset of larval mortality by unaltered total mortality could be observed in comparison to larvae infected by wild-type bacteria."

[See online article for color version of this figure.];  Indeed, no differential accumulation of H2O2 could be visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining of infected Arabidopsis plants at different time points during the interaction (data not shown), and the oxidative stress marker thioredoxin H5 (TRX-h5; Laloi et al., 2004) was severely repressed (Table II).;  The latter transcript data were supported by the strong reduction in ascorbate levels and the accumulation of its precursor dehydroascorbate in infected tissues (Supplemental Fig.;  Symbols (# and *) indicate statistically significant differences between D188-5 and mock-infected samples (P < 0.01) and between D188-5 and D188 samples (P < 0.01), respectively.;  Symbols (# and *) indicate statistically significant changes between D188-5 and mock-infected samples (P < 0.01) and between D188-5 and D188 samples (P < 0.01), respectively.;  Interestingly, throughout the experiment, the total sugar content of shoots was between 2.5- and 2.9-fold higher upon D188 infection than that of the mock-infected control.;  For the sugar alcohols, galactinol accumulated in both D188- and D188-5-infected tissues, albeit with different kinetics, whereas erythritol levels only increased upon D188-5 infection.;  At 24 dpi, the level of trehalose strongly decreased in D188-5-infected tissue and was 5-fold higher in the D188-infected plants.;  For INV-H, no clear pattern was observed, although at 24 dpi the expression was highest in D188-infected plants.;  These transcript profiles and the hexose metabolite data were confirmed by measuring invertase enzyme activities in infected and control shoot material.;  In agreement with the RT-PCR data, a differential activity could also be measured for the cell wall-bound invertase in D188-5-infected tissue (Fig. 7B).;  Given the accumulation of hexoses and the typical sink-associated invertase activity in D188-infected plants, we investigated the effect of infection on photosynthesis.;  The photosynthetic capacity of infected plants was further assessed by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (Fig. 8, C–F).;  B, Symptomatic leaves of infected ARR5:GUS marker lines showing GUS staining at leaf edges.;  Although infection with strain D188 initially led to an accumulation of pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, at 24 dpi, when symptoms were fully established, the levels of all except succinate dropped below those measured in tissues infected with D188-5.;  The most pronounced differential accumulation was measured for Asn, Trp, Tyr, and Ala, whereas the Arg and Orn contents dropped considerably in D188-infected tissues.;  Nevertheless, the mechanisms resulting in the hormone imbalance in the infected plant are completely different, and generally A. tumefaciens-induced tumors consist only of undifferentiated cells (Johnson et al., 1974).;  The observed down-regulation implies that during the interaction with R. fascians D188, no oxidative burst is initiated, which is supported by the down-regulated expression of TRX-h5, a marker for oxidative stress, and the reduced level of ascorbate, a major H2O2-scavenging antioxidant, in infected tissues.;  Moreover, differential accumulation of H2O2 could not be visualized with DAB staining and localized necrosis or cell death was not observed in Arabidopsis tissues infected with the pathogenic or the nonpathogenic R. fascians strains (data not shown).; GO annotation of the differentially expressed genes clearly pointed toward a change in the primary metabolism, a finding that was confirmed by metabolic profiling of tissues infected with R. fascians D188 and D188-5.;  Indeed, the accumulating carbohydrates are good carbon sources for R. fascians (Temmerman et al., 2000), and conversion of infected tissues into a sink has been demonstrated in several other plant-pathogen interactions (Wright et al., 1995; Chou et al., 2000; Herbers et al., 2000; Scharte et al., 2005).;  At 16 d after germination, Arabidopsis plants were infected at the 1.05 stage (Boyes et al., 2001) by local application of a drop of bacterial culture to the shoot apical meristem.; The primary metabolite profiles of complete shoots of mock-inoculated controls and plants infected with R. fascians D188-5 and D188 were compared in six independent biological replicates at 0, 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.;  Mock-inoculated controls and R. fascians-infected plants (strains D188 and D188-5) were compared in their photosynthetic capacity at 4, 7, 14, and 21 dpi."

infection,D007239,23586643,3635983," Several studies of the transcriptional response of citrus plants manifesting HLB symptoms have been reported, but only for CaLas infection.;  We analyzed global changes in gene expression of CaLam-infected leaves of sweet orange during the symptomatic stage of infection and compared the results with previously published microarray studies that used CaLas-infected plants.; The microarray analysis identified 633 differentially expressed genes during the symptomatic stage of CaLam infection.; Many gene transcripts and biological processes are significantly altered upon CaLam infection.;  Some of them had been identified in response to CaLas infection, while others had not been previously reported.;  Small, poor quality and lopsided fruits are frequently observed [5]. There is a clear disturbance of the transport system between source (leaves) and sinks (meristems, fruits, roots), with starch accumulation in plastids, chloroplast disruption, necrotic phloem (probably associated with plugging of sieve cells via callose deposition) and phloem-proteins accumulation [6-8]. Ultrastructural changes in the phloem and adjacent tissues can be observed in plants infected with CaLas, from the early (asymptomatic) stages of infection (three months), progressing to phloem degeneration nine months later [8]. However, before the complete degeneration of the phloem vessels, the bacteria move to newly growing tissues to restart the infection process [8]. Compared with CaLas, CaLam is less effectively transmitted both by vector and by grafting, is more sensitive to higher temperatures and reaches lower titer levels under the same experimental conditions.; Several studies on the transcriptional response of citrus plants showing HLB symptoms have been reported; however, all of them focused on CaLas infection.;  Overall, they show complex gene expression modulation in response to CaLas, but no specific mechanism associated with the infection has been identified yet [6,16-20]. It should be noted that the studies have focused on CaLas because of its worldwide importance; however, finding common features - and differences - between the two species, and differences in the response of citrus to them, may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HLB and how citrus plants respond to the disease.;  The present study evaluated the transcriptional reprogramming of leaf tissue of sweet orange during the symptomatic stage of infection with CaLam, using a robust, customized, 385K-microarray chip containing approximately 32,000 unigenes from Citrus sinensis L.;  Based on these results, we described the main alterations in gene expression during the late stages of infection of CaLam compared with CaLas and discussed how this information could be useful for genetic engineering to control HLB.;  To determine which genes and pathways were relevant during the symptomatic stage of CaLam infection, a GSEA approach was used.; Furthermore, GSEA revealed significant BPs altered in symptomatic plants upon infection with CaLam.; CaLam infection modulated several genes with important functions in the phloem (Additional file 1).; Reprogramming of gene expression upon CaLam infection is regulated by many transcription factors.;  These results differed from those obtained by the microarray, in which transcripts for a SABP3 gene were downregulated, whereas transcripts for USP were slightly induced during the symptomatic phase of CaLam infection compared with the control.; In terms of the differential expression during the asymptomatic or symptomatic stage of infection, some differences were found depending on the bacterium species used.;  In general, few genes expressions were differentially modulated during the asymptomatic phase of CaLam or CaLas infection.; During the symptomatic phase of CaLam infection, transcripts for 12 genes were differentially expressed: auxin efflux carrier, PP2-B10, RLP7 and Kunitz family protein (Additional file 5); CSD2, GPT2, miraculin, NADPH/RbohD, NDR1/HIN1-like 3, PP2-B15, PR6 and starch synthase (Figure 3).;  Unlike CaLam, the expression of six genes was altered during the asymptomatic phase of CaLas infection: GPT2, miraculin, CERK1, PP2-B15, PR6 (Figure 3) and WRKY70 (Additional file 5).;  In addition, transcripts for NADPH/RbohD, oxidorreductases (Figure 3), WRKY25 and PR1 (Additional file 5), were differentially expressed only during the symptomatic stage of CaLas infection.; Our study aimed to investigate the transcriptome reprogramming of citrus upon infection with CaLam.;  High levels of ZIP1 transcripts (FC = 30.48) were also observed in the transcriptome of ‘Navel’ and ‘Madam Vinous’ sweet oranges infected with CaLas, although ZIP1 was not found among the proteins evaluated in the citrus proteome [19]. Similarly, transcripts for a ZIP5 transporter were highly induced in the infected susceptible genotype (Cleopatra mandarin) but not in the tolerant genotype (US-897) [17]. The overexpression of transcripts for Zn transporters in citrus in the late stages of infection with CaLam or CaLas are expected, because the symptoms in the leaves of susceptible citrus plants often resemble those of zinc deficiency.;  In fact, in some citrus genotypes, the concentrations of Zn and Fe in infected plants was found to be approximately half those in healthy plants, which indicates that zinc homoeostasis is significantly affected during infection [24]. As an important micronutrient in plants, zinc has structural (e.g., carbonic anhydrase) and catalytic functions (e.g., superoxide dismutase CuZn-SOD) in many of enzymes.;  An important issue to be addressed is whether Liberibacters could directly or indirectly reduce the availability of this metal as a strategy to favor the infection process [24], as observed for Xanthomonas oryzae in rice [27].; In addition to nutritional deficiencies observed during symptom progression of HLB, several studies reported that CaLas infection dramatically affects carbohydrate metabolism [8,17]. The imbalance of carbohydrate partitioning causes an accumulation of starch in infected leaves during the progression of HLB symptoms.; Transcripts encoding enzymes related to raffinose metabolism, another class of sugars found in phloem sap, were also modulated during CaLam infection.;  Furthermore, RFOs could also function as potent antioxidants to minimize the oxidative stress that occurs near to the necrotic sieve elements formed during CaLam infection.; Transcripts encoding three UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGT84A1; UGT76B1 and a putative UGT) were overexpressed in symptomatic leaves upon infection with CaLam.;  In relation to CaLas, our RT-PCR assays confirmed an induction of PP2-B15 during infection, but PP2-B10 was not significantly modulated.;  Transcripts encoding a CYP83B1 were upregulated in symptomatic flavedo of citrus fruits upon CaLas infection [18]. Indole glucosinolates (IGs) are secondary metabolites derived from tryptophan, which have a well-characterized role in insect resistance [31]. However, Clay and co-workers reported that IGs and their breakdown products were required for callose deposition, which was effective in restricting Pseudomonas syringae growth in Arabidopsis[22]. According to the microarray analysis, transcripts encoding a homogentisate phytyltransferase (VTE2), the first enzyme of the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, were also induced.;  Impairment of phloem loading is a major consequence of Liberibacter infection; therefore, modulation of tocopherol biosynthesis in citrus by overexpression of VTE2 during early infection could be an interesting approach for increasing the phloem translocation of nutrients and for minimizing the symptoms.; Considering that CaLam infection affected different biological processes in citrus, it is not surprising that the expression of many TFs were differentially modulated.;  The most highly induced TF was a myb-like gene, which regulates the expression of several genes in response to phosphate during sucrose starvation in Arabidopsis[34,35]. In addition to having regulatory roles in the defense response upon infection with different pathogens [36-38], several MYB genes have been reported as key regulators of sugar-responsive genes, such as α-amylase during sugar starvation in rice [39]. Interestingly, the same myb-like gene was nearly 200-fold induced in symptomatic leaves of susceptible plants infected with CaLas, but not in the tolerant genotype, indicating that the upregulation of this gene could be associated with the susceptibility of citrus to Ca.;  Liberibacter spp. or, to some extent, to the manifestation of symptoms [17]. Whether this myb-like gene is involved in regulating the expression of defense response genes or sugar metabolism genes in response to CaLam and CaLas infection remains to be proven.;  Our RT-qPCR data showed that both CaLas and CaLam induced PR6 in asymptomatic and symptomatic stages during infection.;  PR6 of Arabidopsis was induced in leaves upon infection with Botrytis cinerea and the resistance against this fungus was enhanced in transgenic lines overexpressing this gene [43]. To the best of our knowledge, few reports have demonstrated the induction of PR6 or other serine-proteinase inhibitors in plants upon infection with bacterial pathogens [44]. Further studies are needed to determine the role of PR6 in the Liberibacters vs.;  This was also observed in transcriptome of citrus leaves upon infection with CaLas [6,17,19]. RT-qPCR analysis showed that transcripts encoding an NADPH oxidase (RbohD), which were slightly induced in the microarray analysis, were significantly repressed during both CaLam and CaLas infection (Figure 3).;  In any case, the role of the oxidative stress during CaLam or CaLam infection needs to be further investigated.; This study aimed to unravel the changes in the transcriptome of symptomatic leaves of sweet orange upon infection with CaLam, using a customized 385K microarray chip containing about 32,000 Citrus sinensis cv Pera unigene transcripts.;  A large number of citrus transcripts and biological processes were significantly altered upon CaLam infection.;  We found several biological processes differentially modulated in leaves during the symptomatic phase of CaLam infection, which are similarly affected by CaLas infection.;  Most of these biological processes probably reflect a secondary, rather than a primary, effect of the infection process.;  For example, the depletion of photosynthesis probably results from a mechanism of feedback inhibition caused by the accumulation of sucrose and glucose in leaves during infection [17]. Moreover, the impairment of the phloem vessels caused by deposition of P-proteins and callose appears to be a late and unsuccessful strategy of defense, because it does not prevent the bacteria from spreading through the plant.; Microarray analysis showed several citrus transcripts that were differentially expressed in symptomatic compared to control plants are annotated as genes responsive to infection by bacterial pathogens, according to sequence homology to Arabidopsis genes.;  The identification of large number of transcripts coding for PR proteins, receptor-like proteins, NBS-LRR and transcription factors (such as WRKY and MYB) shows that even a susceptible citrus genotype is able to actively respond to infection by CaLam, as reported for CaLas.;  For this reason, certain defense-related genes that are able to increase the perception of the pathogen by the host and/or trigger a systemic defense response to CaLam and CaLas infection have been selected as candidates for citrus genetic engineering in our laboratory.;  Hamlin is an important sweet orange worldwide and, like Pera, is highly susceptible to the infection by CaLam or CaLas.;  To compare the differential expression of selected genes in response to the infection with different Liberibacter species, four-month-old shoot-tip grafted (virus-free) plants of Hamlin sweet orange were grafted with two buds from CaLam or CaLas infected sweet orange trees kept in the greenhouse conditions and used as source of inoculum.; To identify relevant molecular mechanisms potentially associated with the response of sweet orange to CaLam infection, GSEA, which evaluates microarray data at the level of gene sets, was carried out [55]. A gene set was defined as all DEGs, with annotation according to A. thaliana, that share the same ontology based on the GO database.;  Once detected, the potentially relevant processes revealed in our analysis were compared to those described in the previously published microarray analysis of citrus infected with CaLas [6,16,17,19]. Although the microarray platforms (Roche Nimblegen versus Affymetrix GeneChip® Citrus Genome Array), chip densities, and EST enrichment libraries used were not the same, we assume that the response detected by different experiments would be similar or even complementary and could thus help us to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the infection of citrus by Ca.;  Two additional defense-related genes, which were not differentially expressed by our microarray results, were tested: a pathogenesis related proteins (PR1), and a phloem protein (PP2-B15), both were reported as significantly induced in citrus upon infection with CaLas [17]. The gene product specific primers were designed using Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) and IDT SciTools Real Time PCR (http://www.idtdna.com/scitools/Applications/RealTimePCR/) software tools with melting temperatures of 60°C, amplicon length of 150 to 200 bp, and a GC content of 50 to 60%. Amplicon specificity was checked by 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and by melting-curve analysis (Additional file 6)."
infection,D007239,8989880,161348," It was previously shown that camalexin accumulation is caused by infection with plant pathogens, by abiotic elicitors, and in spontaneous lesions in the accelerated cell death mutant acd2.;  Production of disease symptoms is not sufficient for the response because systemic infection with cauliflower mosaic virus or cucumber mosaic virus did not induce the tryptophan pathway enzymes or camalexin accumulation."
infection,D007239,23457254,3624589," Phenazines are well known for their toxicity against non-phenazine-producing organisms, which allows them to serve as crucial biocontrol agents and virulence factors during infection.;  Phenazines also serve as crucial antimicrobial agents, enabling bacteria to kill off competing microorganisms (8–10) and cause disease in a eukaryotic host during infection (11, 12).;  Indeed, a hallmark feature of P. aeruginosa infections in individuals suffering from the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis is the production of the blue phenazine pyocyanin."
infection,D007239,28421168,5376624," All of the experimental infection assays indicated that the virulence of the ATCC 17978 was significantly reduced when this gene was inactivated.;  Furthermore, improved strategies for functional analysis of bacterial genes and the use of relevant animal models have provided novel insights into the virulence traits of this pathogen, which could lead to potential targets for the treatment of human infections (McConnell et al., 2013).; The inhibition of bacterial functions involved in quorum sensing, adhesion, colonization, iron acquisition and/or resistance to host defenses are possible strategies that could be used to fight bacterial infections, particularly those caused by MDR pathogens (Escaich, 2010).;  The acinetobactin-mediated iron acquisition system and related iron-mediated metabolic functions also play a role in A. baumannii ATCC 19606T virulence as assessed using ex vivo and in vivo infection models (Gaddy et al., 2012; Zimbler et al., 2012, 2013).;  These observations indicate that the A1S_0114 gene could play a critical role in the pathobiology of A. baumannii, knowledge that could aid in the design of alternative therapeutic tools needed for the treatment of infections caused by emerging MDR isolates.;  Then, the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 was used; in each well 105 A549 cells were infected with 106 bacteria and incubated for 3 h in mHBSS at 37°C.;  The dose used for each infection consisted of a 5 μl-suspension containing 105 CFU (Gaddy et al., 2012).; The biological effect of the A1S_0114 deletion was also tested using A549 human alveolar epithelial cells as a model since they represent a host cell that could be targeted by A. baumannii during the pathogenesis of respiratory infections.;  Although the infection of A549 polarized samples by Δ0114 bacteria also resulted in destruction of the surfactant layer and cell damage, it appears that the deletion of A1S_0114 results in a readily detectable reduction of bacteria attached to the polarized samples (Figure ​(Figure3B3B).;  Similarly, infection of G. mellonella larvae showed that ca. 50% of them died 5 days after being injected with 17978 (Figure ​(Figure4B).4B).;  Although the infection of caterpillars with Δ0114 showed a killing rate that was significantly higher than the negative controls, the virulence of the mutant was significantly attenuated when compared with the parental strain (P = 0.025).;  Finally, the ability of the Δ0114 mutant to establish infection in an experimental murine model was evaluated.;  This model showed that lungs from mice infected with Δ0114 displayed a significantly lower bacterial burden than those from animals infected with 17978 (P = 0.0165) after 44 h of intratracheal infection (Figure ​(Figure4C4C).;  The number of bacterial cells in lung homogenates was determined 24 h post infection.;  Interestingly, although the infection of polarized A549 cells with the Δ0114 mutant resulted in less biofilm formation on the surface of polarized cells, it did not result in an appreciable difference in the damage of the eukaryotic cells and the mucin layer that covers them when compared with samples incubated with the 17978 parent strain under the same experimental conditions (Figure ​(Figure3).3).;  This observation suggests that A1S_0114 differentially affects distinct host-pathogen interactions that ultimately lead to the pathogenesis of respiratory infections caused by this pathogen.; This report also provides the first experimental evidence that the A1S_0114 gene contributes to the virulence of A. baumannii when tested with three different experimental infection models already used to study A. baumannii's virulence.;  It is apparent from our data that the marker-less deletion of A1S_0114, caused a significant reduction in virulence independently of the experimental infection model used to test this phenotype (Figure ​(Figure4),4), without affecting the overall growth of this derivative in rich medium when compared to the 17978 parental strain (Figure S2).;  Collection of samples at different times after infection (24 vs. 44 h) and the use of different mice strains (BALB/c vs.;  Similarly, different infection routes (pneumonia vs. bloodstream infection) and mice strains (BALB/c vs. leukopenic CBA/J) used to identified 17978 genes required for bacterial survival in the bloodstream of infected mice could explain the observation that mutants with random insertions in all A1S_0112-A1S_0119 genes did not meet the threshold to be considered critical for bacterial survival and no insertion within A1S_0114 was reported (Subashchandrabose et al., 2016).;  Genetic differences between the 17978 and AB5075 A. baumannii strains that resulted in apparent virulence differences using the G. mellonella as a host (Gebhardt et al., 2015) could explain the observation that none of the A1S_0112-A1S_0119 genes were identified as virulence genes when tested using this experimental infection model, which proved the critical role iron acquisition plays in A. baumannii's virulence (Gaddy et al., 2012).;  Such knowledge would provide novel insights into the pathobiology of A. baumannii and potentially facilitate the development of alternative tools needed for the treatment of infections caused by MDR isolates."
infection,D007239,24130811,3793909," Our data from transcriptional analysis further confirmed that this signaling system directly or indirectly regulated the expressions of two major virulence proteases in the infection of B. nematocida B16.;  Then the pathogenic factors, mainly including an extracellular alkaline serine protease Bace16 and a neutral protease Bae16, are responsible for death of nematodes [2]. In this type of multistep infection process that has characteristics of “social” behavior, a precise “combat command system” should be required to modulate these processes in infection, but remains unknown.;  Thus, our investigation is the first report about the roles of signaling system ComP-ComA in the infection of bacterial pathogens.; To investigate the involvement of ComP-ComA in regulating the synthesis of the VOCs that had been suggested the prerequisites for successful infection against nematodes [2], the mutants of genes comP and comA were constructed to testify their effects on nematitoxic activities respectively.; In many organisms, the production of extracellular degradative enzymes is controlled by the QS system [22]. This probably reflects the need to accumulate a sufficient extracellular concentration of the enzymes to degrade enough nutrients or to prepare for infection.;  By interacting with other transcription factors, the ComP-ComA system could enhance its ability to regulate the infection process.;  At the same time, ComA utilized transcriptional network through its impact on the expression of other transcription factors, including degQ-degU system, to participate in infection indirectly."
infection,D007239,23002228,3497527," Both rpoB mutants showed significant upregulation of the polyketide synthase genes ppsA-ppsE and drrA, which constitute an operon encoding multifunctional enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate and other lipids in M. tuberculosis, but also of various secondary metabolites in related organisms, including antibiotics, such as erythromycin and rifamycins. ppsA (Rv2931), ppsB (Rv2932), and ppsC (Rv2933) were also found to be upregulated more than 10-fold in the Beijing rpoB mutant strain relative to its wild-type parent strain during infection of activated murine macrophages.;  These findings may assist in developing novel methods to diagnose and treat drug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections.;  A total of 103 cells were activated by addition of 50 ng/ml gamma interferon (IFN-γ) (Roche) overnight and 200 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (from Escherichia coli 026:B6; <5% protein [Lowry]; Sigma) for 3 h prior to infection.;  After removal of the medium, the cells were incubated for 3 h with either wild-type M. tuberculosis or the rpoB mutant at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1.;  For mycobacterial gene expression studies, intracellular bacteria were recovered at 72 h after infection by centrifugation at 3,200 rpm for 5 min, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).;  Next, using qRT-PCR, we sought to determine the effect of rpoB mutation on the expression levels of selected PDIM biosynthesis genes during M. tuberculosis infection of activated murine macrophages.; Effects of rpoB S450L mutation on M. tuberculosis gene expression and fitness. (A) Expression of the PDIM biosynthesis locus in the rpoB mutant Beijing strain relative to the rifampin-sensitive wild-type parent strain during logarithmic growth in nutrient-rich broth, as measured by RT-PCR. (B) Gene expression of the same strains after 72 h of infection in activated murine macrophages. (C) Growth and survival of the rpoB mutant (gray) relative to the Beijing wild-type parent strain (white) in activated murine macrophages. (D) RT-PCR analysis of gene expression in a laboratory-generated RpoB S450L mutant relative to the isogenic CDC1551 wild-type strain during logarithmic growth in nutrient-rich broth.;  Thus, although we cannot discern the physiological importance of PDIM upregulation by rpoB mutants from these data, it is possible that upregulation of the PDIM pathway is related to increased pressure for rpoB mutants to maintain or remodel the cell wall, particularly during host cell infection.;  Furthermore, if certain genes are expressed preferentially by rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, immune responses to the corresponding proteins could be investigated as a way to identify individuals with rifampin-resistant latent M. tuberculosis infection."
infection,D007239,28116768,5546091," L. pneumophila encodes an orphan biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that contains isocyanide-associated biosynthetic genes and is upregulated during infection.;  This host diversity has facilitated its ability to infect and intracellularly replicate in human macrophages.[1] Human infection results in either a mild influenza-like disease called Pontiac fever or the much more severe pneumomia termed Legionellosis (Legionnaires’ disease).;  L. pneumophila is predicted to employ a staggering number of more than 300 effector proteins during infection.[3,4] The remaining effector proteins are hypothesized to stem from the broad range of hosts infected by L. pneumophila.;  As part of that study, legionellol, a polyketide-derived surfactant that affected sliding mobility was identified.[5] Other secondary metabolites from Legionella include the siderophore legiobactin[6] and the quorum sensing auto-inducer LAI-1.[7] We were intrigued by a BGC in L. pneumophila containing the isocyanide-associated genes isnA and isnB because previous work has demonstrated that isocyanide-containing secondary metabolites dramatically affect innate immunosuppression in an invertebrate animal infection model, Galleria mellonella.[8] Given the fact that the isnA and isnB genes are clustered in various human pathogens, we aimed to elucidate the structures of the secondary metabolites encoded by this BGC using heterologous expression, a chemoselective tetrazine probe, gene deletion in wild-type L. pneumophila, and intracellular growth in both amoebae and macrophages.;  Interestingly, the gene cluster is up-regulated at the transcriptional level during intracellular bacterial growth in human macrophages,[15] suggesting a potential role in infection.; Based on observation of the up-regulation of this gene cluster during intracellular infection, we examined the impact of isocyanide and acyl-histidine production on intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and the natural protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii.;  NLRC4−/− BMDM, which are permissive to infection with flagellated L. pneumophila,[32] and A. castellanii were infected with wild-type (SRS43), lpg0174::Tn, or lpg0178::Tn mutant L. pneumophila followed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFUs) recovered over 72 hours.;  The enzyme responsible for N-acylation, lpg0178 from the ATP-grasp family (PF13535) represents an alternative to the N-acyl transferase family (PF13444) responsible for synthesizing N-acyl-tyrosines, N-acyl-arginines, and commendamide through preactivated carboxylates[28] or the transacylation from glycerophospholipids employed in the biosynthesis of the well-known human N-acyl amide anandamide.[34] The biosynthetic genes for the new N-acyl-histidine metabolites reported here are up-regulated during intracellular L. pneumophila macrophage infection, lending further support to the general notion that structurally diverse N-acyl amides could regulate a variety of human cellular signaling programs.; Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff (ATCC #30010) were maintained in PYG media and cultured at 25°C as previously described.[49] For infections, cells were seeded into 24 well tissue culture dishes at 2.5 × 105/well in PYG medium and allowed to adhere for 2h prior to infection.;  Cells were washed in warm Ac buffer and infected with the indicated strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.8 in pre-warmed Ac buffer (4 mM MgSO4, 0.4 M CaCl2, 0.1% sodium citrate dehydrate, 0.05 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 • 6H2O, 2.5 mM NaH2PO3, 2.5 mM K2HPO3, pH 6.5)."
infection,D007239,24884988,4091270,"Increasing evidence has shown that
small-molecule chemistry in
microbes (i.e., secondary metabolism) can modulate the microbe–host
response in infection and pathogenicity.; Burkholderia
pseudomallei (BP) is the causative agent
for the bacterial septic disease melioidosis.
Melioidosis is endemic throughout the tropical Southeast Pacific region
and is considered a growing global health threat.1BP, an environmental saphrophyte
by nature, is intrinsically resistant to multiple antibiotics due
to factors including drug inactivation (e.g., β-lactamase activity),
a multidrug efflux pump system, and an adaptive physiology that can
alter drug target sites throughout disease progression.2 As a result, mortality rates from melioidosis
can approach ∼50% even with antibiotic treatment.3 Despite increased scrutiny in recent years, the
mechanisms by which BP can establish and propagate
an infection have remained unclear.; Examining the influence
of secondary metabolism on bacterial pathogenicity.
(A) Bacterial pathogens typically produce a limited number of metabolites
under laboratory fermentation conditions, (B) while having the capacity
to produce multiple metabolites within the context of an infection,
which can function as virulence factors. (C) Cryptic/silent gene clusters
can be identified bioinformatically in sequenced pathogen genomes.
Through genome engineering, individual biosynthetic clusters can be
both activated for accessing the encoded molecules and disrupted for
determining their influence on bacterial pathogenicity. (D) Virulence
factor biosynthesis can be targeted for the development of new disease-specific
therapeutics.;  These gene cluster disruption
strains were then tested for pathogenicity using an intranasal
murine infection model (Figure ​(Figure3).3).; 21-day murine intranasal infection challenge
of wild-type BP and the disruption mutants of biosynthetic
clusters 2,
11, 14, and 15.;  On the basis
of these observations, we believe malleipeptins are biosurfactants
that are required at some stage during BP infections.;  Proteasome inhibition
is known to directly activate programmed cell death through induction
of apoptosis and autophagy across multiple cell lines, including macrophages.28−31 In the context of BP infections, autophagy has
been shown to be critical for diverting host nutrients to the pathogen.32 Proteasome inhibition by the glidobactins
could therefore provide the mechanistic explanation for both promoting
intracellular replication or, in the case of macrophages, immunosuppression,
which has long been suspected within BP pathogenicity.33 In light of the importance of these small molecules
to BP pathogenesis, the inhibition of their biosyntheses
could prove to be a productive avenue for the development of next-generation
therapeutics for combating melioidosis."
infection,D007239,24445449,3950275," Here we show that antibiotic treatment induces substantial changes in the gut microbial community and in the metabolome of mice susceptible to C. difficile infection.;  Within the past decade, new focus has been put on C. difficile due to an increase in morbidity, mortality and health care costs associated with infection by this pathogen2,3.;  Hospitalization, age greater than 65 years and antibiotic treatment are the primary risk factors for C. difficile infection (CDI)4,5.; To link microbiome community structure to function in the setting of C. difficile infection, we undertook a multi-omics approach to characterize the changes in the murine gut microbiome and metabolome following antibiotic administration.; 5–14 week old C57BL/6 WT mice (male or female) were used from a breeding colony that was established using animals purchased from Jackson Laboratories for the experimental infections.;  At the time of necropsy (2 days post infection) bacterial enumeration was done from the cecal content of animals infected with C. difficile on TCCFA selective agar to quantitate levels of colonization."
infection,D007239,25044543,4234257," The latter suggested a direct effect of Pam on honey bee larval death which could, however, not be corroborated in laboratory infection assays.; Despite the enormous impact of this disease, molecular mechanisms of infection are not fully understood.;  The relevance of secondary metabolites like sevadicin (Garcia-Gonzalez et al. 2014) during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections still remains elusive.;  Preparation of spore suspension for infection assays was performed as previously described (Genersch et al. 2005, 2006; Rauch et al. 2009; Poppinga et al. 2012; Fünfhaus et al. 2013).;  Larvae of first instar were infected with P. larvae ERIC II wild-type (DSM25430) and the Pam deficient knock-out mutant (DSM25430 ΔpamA) by adding corresponding spores in a final concentration of 500 cfu/mL (about LC100) to the larval diet to ensure that infection of larvae was initiated by the same number of vegetative P. larvae for wild-type and knock-out bacteria.; Based on the in vitro cytotoxic activity of purified Pam against insect cells we hypothesized that Pam might act as toxin during P. larvae infection.;  This result did not corroborate a function of Pam as toxin during infection despite its cytotoxicity in vitro and exemplified that in the P. larvae/honey bee larvae system it is obviously not always possible to infer from in vitro data on in vivo function.; Role of paenilamicin during infection of honey bee larvae. (A) First instar honey bee larvae were infected with P. larvae DSM25430 wt and DSM25430 ΔpamA.;  Daily mortality due to P. larvae infection was recorded and total mortality was calculated.;  No significant difference in total mortality was observed. (B) Daily mortality due to P. larvae infection was recorded and cumulative mortality was calculated.; Analyzing the time course of infection revealed that the curve for cumulative mortality was shifted to the right for the groups infected with the mutant strain (Fig.​(Fig.7B)7B) indicating that in these groups the onset of larval dying was significantly delayed in comparison to the groups infected with wild-type bacteria (P = 0.028; two-way ANOVA).;  If the function of Pam were to act as cytotoxin during infection and to help breaching the epithelial cell layer (Yue et al. 2008) we would have expected a similar significant reduction in total mortality in the absence of this toxin, especially because so far no toxin gene has been identified in this strain (Djukic et al. 2014).;  This suggested that Pam might play a role in the very early phase of infection when P. larvae germinates and starts to colonize the larval midgut.;  Therefore, more experimental work is necessary to unravel the exact function of Pam in pathogenesis of P. larvae infections and to explain its influence on virulence of P. larvae.;  In addition, we demonstrated that paenilamcin has cytotoxic activity against insect cells, although a function as toxin during P. larvae infection of honey bee larvae could not be confirmed."
infection,D007239,25101956,4125134," Developed PTI is also able to protect the plant from disease or HR (Hypersensitive Response) after a challenging infection with pathogenic bacteria.; Previous works from our laboratory showed that heat-killed pathogenic bacteria injected into tobacco leaves are able to induce a symptomless local resistance that protects the plant from a following compatible infection, or the hypersensitive response, when re-inoculated with compatible or incompatible pathogens respectively [15], [16]. Later on we found that this local resistance can not only be induced by heat-killed pathogens, but also by saprobic bacteria and some hrp/hrc mutants; i.e. pathogens mutated in their hypersensitivity and pathogenicity genes, many of which code for elements of the Type III Protein Secretion System (T3SS) [17]. Based on our previous findings we regard the local resistance of tobacco as a manifestation of PTI.;  Treatments inducing PTI in planta, such as injection of flg22 peptide or infection with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrpA resulted in activation of 220–250 genes within 0.5–7 hours according to the above authors.;  The detected transcriptional activation of flax phenylpropanoid genes in response to Fusarium infection was supported by metabolite profiling."
infection,D007239,23457628,3572970," The primary objective was to determine the contribution of choline conversion to glycine betaine to P. aeruginosa survival during mouse lung infection.;  A secondary objective was to gain insight into the relative contributions of the different roles of glycine betaine to P. aeruginosa survival during infection.;  Deletion of betBA decreased the abundance of plcH transcript during infection, which suggested a role for PlcH in the betBA survival defect.;  The betBA and betBAplcHR double mutant had a small but significant survival defect compared to the plcHR single mutant, suggesting that regulation of plcH expression is not the only role for glycine betaine during infection.; 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram negative pathogen that causes a variety of serious and life threatening infections.;  P. aeruginosa lung infection is an important component of disease in people with cystic fibrosis and a substantial source of morbidity and mortality in people undergoing mechanical ventilation [1], [2]. In these settings, antibiotic resistance is a rapidly growing problem, thus there is need for novel therapeutic targets [3], [4]. Acquisition and metabolism of small molecules from the host is an important part of establishment and maintenance of infection [5], [6], [7]. These bacterial pathways define a set of potential – yet largely uncharacterized – targets for drug development.;  We are interested in understanding the host-derived small molecules that are important for P. aeruginosa survival during infection in the mammalian lung.; Analyses of the P. aeruginosa transcriptome during growth in cystic fibrosis sputum and normal human mucus showed strong induction of the genes involved in choline transport and catabolism [8], [9], suggesting that choline may be an important molecule for P. aeruginosa during infection.; The importance of PlcH during infection, and the control of plcH transcription by GB activation of GbdR, led us to hypothesize that conversion of host choline to GB would play a role in P. aeruginosa biology during lung infection.;  While we are not the first to propose that catabolism of choline could be an important metabolic process for P. aeruginosa during infection [20], [28], [29], the contribution of choline catabolism had not been directly tested in vivo.;  In this study we have used a mouse model of P. aeruginosa lung infection to understand the contribution of choline catabolism to P. aeruginosa survival during lung infection.; The protocol for animal infection was approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines (Animal Welfare Assurance: A3301-01).; We have previously described the construction of the plcHR deletion mutant used for mouse infections [26]. To generate the ΔbetBAΔplcHR double mutant, we constructed the plcHR deletion in the ΔbetBA (MJ311) strain, using the deletion plasmid described previously [26]. Transformation into S17λ/pir, conjugation, and selection of single and double recombinants was done as described previously [30].; We used the oropharyngeal route of mouse lung infection as we previously described [26]. Briefly, cells were streaked onto LB plates from −80 °C stocks.;  Anesthesia, surgery, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collection, organ harvest, and organ homogenization were done as previously described [26] at either 4 or 24 hours post-infection.;  Colony forming units (CFU) per lung, infiltrating white blood cells (WBC), and protein content of cell-free brochoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) measured after the labeled duration of infection.; Mice were infected with P. aeruginosa via oropharyngeal aspiration and harvested 24 hours post-infection.; Mice were infected with P. aeruginosa via oropharyngeal aspiration and harvested 24 hours post-infection.;  The dotted line in Fig 4A and 4C represent the mean of three independent experiments with wild-type PAO1 infection.;  GB can function as an osmoprotectant, an inducer of plcH and other GbdR-controlled transcripts, and as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy [16], [27], [41]. The multifunctional nature of GB led us to hypothesize that loss of GB acquisition during infection would lead to decreased bacterial survival and/or virulence.;  To test this hypothesis, we examined the importance of the choline oxidation step, encoded by betBA, during infection.; The abundance of the choline precursors phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in the lung [10], [11] led us and others to predict a role for choline catabolism during infection [16], [28], [29]. To measure the contribution of choline catabolism during P. aeruginosa lung infection, we inoculated mice with PAO1 wild-type, a betBA deletion strain (ΔbetBA), or a wild-type reversion strain made by complementing the betBA deletion in PAO1 with the PA14 betBA genes to reconstruct the betBA locus.;  The data shown in Figure 1A demonstrate that deletion of betBA results in decreased bacterial survival 24 hours post-infection, which can be complemented by reversion to a functional betBA locus (14Rev) (ANOVA p value = 0.005).; The contribution of betBA to survival for E. coli and Pseudomonas has been hypothesized and others have demonstrated in vitro growth defects using genetic or chemical inhibition of betBA in host-like (or host-derived) media [14], [42]. To our knowledge, however, this is the first demonstration of a survival defect for a choline catabolic mutant in an animal infection model.;  A survival difference between the mutant and wild type was detectable at 4 hours post-infection (Fig. 1D), suggesting that a portion of the survival defect is due to events occurring prior to the arrival of the bulk of the circulating neutrophils (Fig. 1E, note scale compared to Fig. 1B).; The host response to P. aeruginosa in acute infection models appears largely driven by innate immune response to TLR ligands and the response of the infiltrating neutrophils.;  Because of this, we suspect that while our bacterial cell numbers are substantially different from the bacteria's point of view, the host is still rapidly clearing infections of both wild-type and the betBA deletion mutant (Fig. 1).;  Most of the responses that give rise to the metrics that we use to grossly assess the host response are likely initiated and propagated normally in both infections.;  Here we suspect the influence of reduced plcH expression in the betBA mutant, as PlcH has been shown to damage epithelium and endothelium, and we have previously shown that deletion of plcH reduces protein concentration in the BALF [26], [34], [53], [54]. We have also measured cytokines typical of P. aeruginosa infections in mice (IL-6, TNFα, and KC) and detected no statistically significant change between wild-type and mutant infections at either 4 or 24 hours post-infection (data not shown).;  In P. aeruginosa, GB demethylation is dependent on the gbcA and gbcB genes [16]. This means that a gbcA-B deletion mutant cannot convert GB to DMG and thus is unable to catabolize GB as a sole carbon or nitrogen source [16]. To test the contribution of GB catabolism to virulence, we infected mice with WT PAO1 and an isogenic ΔgbcA-B deletion strain and examined experimental endpoints 24 hours post-infection.;  This demonstrates that GB catabolism is not required for P. aeruginosa survival in this model of infection, either as a nutrient source or as a precursor to other metabolites.;  In addition, there are no robust molecular markers for the low-intensity osmostress predicted to be sensed by P. aeruginosa in the host [39]. We have previously reported that deletion of plcHR, the genes coding for the phospholipase C virulence factor PlcHR, reduced virulence in our mouse model [26]. If choline was the sole source of GB during infection, we would predict ablation of plcH induction in a betBA mutant in vivo.;  Therefore we chose to examine the impact of betBA deletion on plcH transcript abundance during infection using Taq-man quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with the ppiD transcript as our control transcript.;  Expression of plcH during infection with wild-type bacteria was variable but high, while these levels were significantly reduced during infection with the betBA mutant (Fig. 3) (ANOVA p value = 0.0003).;  We predict that the gbdR mutant infection demonstrates the baseline transcription from the plcH locus in the absence of induction (Fig. 3, last group), as our current data supports GbdR as the primary regulator of plcH during infection [27].; In a betBA mutant, plcH transcript levels are reduced during infection, and while the trend was higher expression than in the ΔgbdR strain, this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3).;  There are non-choline sources of GB in the host, including free GB and carnitine [14], [55]. Both of these compounds are present at low levels in the lung (low µM quantities) [56]. However, given the transport Kd's for both GB and carnitine [38], both could be accumulated during infection.;  We have previously demonstrated that deletion of plcHR reduces P. aeruginosa survival in the lung using an infection model identical to our 24 h LB infection [26]. To test the relationship between the ΔbetBA survival phenotype and that of the ΔplcHR strain, we generated a ΔbetBAΔplcHR double deletion mutant.;  While PlcH is the only known secreted virulence factor controlled by GbdR, GbdR controls a regulon that includes genes of unknown function (Hampel and Wargo, unpublished data); therefore one of these genes may be important for infection.; Conversion of choline to GB contributes to P. aeruginosa survival during infection.; I'd like to thank Jenna Bement for extensive technical assistance in the animal handling, infections, and surgeries."

Increases to levels of polyphenolic substances have been demonstrated in plants during fungal infection, suggesting that these molecules may be part of the host-defense mechanism [10], [11].; Antimicrobial resistance continues to evolve presenting serious challenges to current medical practices to treat community-acquired infections.;  Often the most talked about infections are bacterial in nature from both gram-positive and gram-negative species [30]. Hoever, fungal species also pose a serious burden on our healthcare system.;  AIDS patients develop cryptococcal infections, some areas of Africa, such as Zimbabwe, have infection rates as high as 88% [32]. This makes developing new antifungal agents a critical endeavor as cryptococcal species are rapidly developing resistance to current compounds."
infection,D007239,19118125,2649413," Gene Ontology categorization of the differentially expressed genes hinted at a significant impact of infection on the primary metabolism of the host, which was confirmed by subsequent metabolite profiling.;  These data are placed in the context of regulation of bacterial virulence gene expression, suppression of defense, infection phenotype, and niche establishment.; Upon infection with the Gram-positive, cytokinin-producing phytopathogen Rhodococcus fascians, the architecture of the plant is drastically changed (Crespi et al., 1992, 1994; Vereecke et al., 2000, 2002a, 2002b; Goethals et al., 2001; de O Manes et al., 2004).;  For RNA preparation, plant material was harvested at three developmentally distinct time points: at 7 d postinfection (dpi) with the virulent R. fascians D188 strain, no clear symptoms were observed; at 14 dpi, the macroscopic phenotype became apparent; and at 24 dpi, Arabidopsis displayed the typical disease symptoms described above (Fig. 1A).; Differentially up-regulated genes upon infection of Arabidopsis with R. fascians D188; Differentially down-regulated genes upon infection of Arabidopsis with R. fascians D188; GO annotation of the 2-fold differentially up- and down-regulated genes upon R. fascians infection.;  IPT8, unlike IPT3 not negatively regulated by cytokinins (Miyawaki et al., 2004), showed a minor up-regulation throughout infection.; As the data presented above confirm the central role of cytokinins, we wondered how conserved the global transcriptional response upon R. fascians infection was when compared with cytokinin treatment and upon challenge with other pathogens.;  Therefore, biclustering analyses were done with the Genevestigator tool (Zimmermann et al., 2004) on the genes listed in Tables I and ​andIIII in relevant publicly available data sets (zeatin treatment; infection with bacteria [Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae], gray mold [Botrytis cinerea], two powdery mildews [Erysiphe cichoracearum and Erysiphe orontii], and an oomycete [Phytophthora infestans]).;  Approximately 12% of the down-regulated and 30% of the up-regulated transcripts were common between cytokinin treatment and R. fascians infection.;  However, many of the transcriptional changes induced upon cytokinin treatment were not activated upon infection.;  For instance, Bet v 1 genes, encoding putative cytokinin-detoxifying proteins, were induced by cytokinins (Mogensen et al., 2002; Brenner et al., 2005), but three family members were down-regulated upon R. fascians infection (Table II).;  Interestingly, the transcriptional overlap with A. tumefaciens was considerably higher, 38% and 45% of the down- and up-regulated genes, respectively, implying extensive similarities in the host response toward infection with both gall-forming bacteria.; Output of Genevestigator bicluster analyses comparing R. fascians infection with hormone treatment and biotic interactions.; Detailed symptom analysis in tobacco and Arabidopsis did not point to a defense reaction of the plant in response to infection (de O Manes et al., 2001, 2004).;  Five out of seven differential peroxidases (PER21, PER33, PER50, PERATP23A, and a putative peroxidase), together with a putative copper amino oxidase (At1g62810) that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of polyamines resulting in the release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), were significantly down-regulated upon infection with strain D188 (Table II; Supplemental Table S1), suggesting that R. fascians D188 colonization did not trigger H2O2 production.;  Moreover, the expression of (stromal) l-ascorbate peroxidase (APX1 and sAPX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX5 and GPX6), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CSD1 and CSD2), and catalase (CAT1 and CAT2) genes, known to be ROS scavengers (Mittler et al., 2004), was also down-regulated upon infection with strain D188 (Table II; Supplemental Table S1).;  Altogether, these data indicated that infection with R. fascians does not cause an oxidative burst in the plant.;  Although a few genes were up-regulated throughout R. fascians infection, most were down-regulated in the later stages (Supplemental Table S1), among them established defense markers, such as Phe ammonia lyases, suggesting active defense suppression by R. fascians D188.; To get a clue on which bacterial signal could be involved in defense suppression, we evaluated the expression of the differentially expressed stress-related genes upon D188 infection (Fig. 5A for Table II, Fig. 5B for Supplemental Table S1) in data sets obtained from other biotic interactions and cytokinin and auxin treatments.; Genevestigator study of the stress- and defense-related genes upon R. fascians infection.;  B, Responses of all differentially regulated defense-related genes after R. fascians infection (Supplemental Table S1) and their responses upon hormone treatment.;  Genes that are down-regulated in at least one time point upon R. fascians infection are not marked, while asterisks indicate up-regulated genes throughout R. fascians infection.;  These transcript data suggested that infection might significantly modulate the primary metabolism of the plant.;  For a more comprehensive view, profiles of 38 primary metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of extracts prepared from complete Arabidopsis shoots at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi treated as follows: mock inoculation with water, control infection with strain D188-5, or infection with strain D188.;  Although this study is focused on the differences between D188-5 and D188 infections, to correlate metabolic shifts with disease development, we noticed that for some metabolites D188-5 infection caused notable changes compared with mock-inoculated controls (indicated by # in Figs. 6, ​,10,10, and ​and1111 and Supplemental Fig.;  S4), which could be correlated with a general reaction to bacterial colonization or with early flowering, which is a conserved developmental response on bacterial infection (Korves and Bergelson, 2003).; Effect of R. fascians infection on carbon metabolism in planta.; Responses of pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates upon infection with R. fascians.;  Mock, R. fascians D188-5, and D188 infection at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.; Effect of R. fascians infection on amino acids, putrescine, and glycerate levels.;  Mock, R. fascians D188-5, and D188 infection at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.; During plant development, but also upon pathogen infections, source-to-sink transitions occur in tissues, with the conversion from a sugar-producing and -exporting status to a sugar-importing and -accumulating status as a result.;  Interestingly, throughout the experiment, the total sugar content of shoots was between 2.5- and 2.9-fold higher upon D188 infection than that of the mock-infected control.;  For the sugar alcohols, galactinol accumulated in both D188- and D188-5-infected tissues, albeit with different kinetics, whereas erythritol levels only increased upon D188-5 infection.;  The profiles for glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate were comparable for the three treatments, whereas the concentration of myoinositol was somewhat higher upon infection.;  The most striking difference was observed for the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose, which accumulated upon infection with strain D188-5 and strain D188 at 4 dpi between 64- and 42-fold, respectively.; The specific increase in the hexose-Suc ratio only upon R. fascians D188 infection hinted at a possible involvement of invertases.;  The expression of the cell wall invertase gene was already induced at 4 dpi by both bacterial infections (D188-5 and D188), but the induction was stronger and only persisted throughout the experiment upon infection with strain D188.;  Indeed, for all three invertase types, the enzyme activities were significantly higher upon D188 infection.; Invertase gene expression and activities upon R. fascians infection.;  Given the accumulation of hexoses and the typical sink-associated invertase activity in D188-infected plants, we investigated the effect of infection on photosynthesis.;  Generally, D188-5 infection had no or little effect on the age-dependent decline of RbcS and CAB2 expression levels.;  In contrast, upon D188 infection, both RbcS and CAB2 were significantly down-regulated already at 4 dpi (Fig. 8B).;  The effective quantum yield of PSII [Y(II)], the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), and the nonphotochemical quenching parameters NPQ and qN (see “Materials and Methods”) were measured during R. fascians infection.;  Whereas Y(II) was not significantly altered by infection of Arabidopsis with strain D188-5, it was markedly reduced by D188 infection.;  CKX genes are instrumental for cytokinin degradation and homeostasis upon infection of Arabidopsis with R. fascians (Depuydt et al., 2008; Pertry et al., 2009).; Decrease in photosynthesis after R. fascians infection.;  B, RT-PCR profiling of the RbcS and CAB2 genes upon mock, R. fascians D188-5, and D188 infections.;  C, False-color-coded image of Y(II) upon R. fascians D188-5 and D188 infection at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.;  D, Fv/Fm values upon water, R. fascians D188-5, and D188 infection.;  E, False color-coded image of qN after R. fascians D188-5 and D188 infection at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.;  F, Distribution of Y(II), Y(NPQ), and Y(NO) upon mock, R. fascians D188-5, and D188 infection at 4, 7, 14, and 24 dpi.; The Fv/Fm, a measure of the intrinsic efficiency of PSII, was also significantly lower upon D188 infection (Fig. 8D), indicating photoinhibition.;  The decrease of Y(II) upon D188 infection was largely paralleled by an increase in Y(NO), indicating inhibition of photosynthesis.;  Moreover, all of the TCA cycle genes in the list of 3,422 differentially regulated genes were down-regulated at 24 dpi (Supplemental Table S2), further suggesting reduced functioning of the TCA cycle upon infection with R. fascians D188.;  Although infection with strain D188 initially led to an accumulation of pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, at 24 dpi, when symptoms were fully established, the levels of all except succinate dropped below those measured in tissues infected with D188-5.;  Upon infection with D188, especially at the later time points of the interaction, Gly and Ser levels were significantly lower than those of the controls (Fig. 11); in contrast, glycerate levels were up to 7-fold higher upon D188 infection, implying a flux toward this metabolite and illustrating a possible enhancement of photorespiration.;  Nevertheless, infection with D188 generally resulted in a faster and stronger increase.;  Indeed, putrescine levels strongly increased upon R. fascians D188 infection already at 4 dpi (Fig. 11).; The plant pathogenic actinomycete R. fascians is rather unique among the hyperplasia-inducing bacteria because it induces the formation of differentiated galls upon infection of its many hosts (Putnam and Miller, 2007).;  Consequently, infection results in the amplification of young tissues that do not mature.;  However, the data set of genes 2-fold differentially expressed upon infection overlapped only minimally with publicly available microarray data sets that dealt with hormone treatments or biotic interactions.; Remarkably, the expression of genes encoding several peroxidases, a copper amino oxidase, and catalase, superoxide dismutase, and l-ascorbate peroxidases was significantly down-regulated upon infection with the pathogenic strain D188.;  Indeed, phenolic compounds do not accumulate at the infection site (Vereecke et al., 2000; Cornelis et al., 2001), and many defense-related genes are down-regulated upon D188 infection.;  Intriguingly, bacterial infection in general had a measurable impact on the primary metabolism of the plant, although the alterations induced by the pathogenic strain were much stronger.;  Importantly, upon infection, invertase transcripts and activities were strongly enhanced, probably accounting for the observed increase in the hexose-Suc ratio and illustrating the establishment of a sink (Smeekens, 2000; Roitsch and González, 2004; Rolland et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2007).;  Several genes encoding sugar transporters were indeed differentially regulated upon R. fascians infection (data not shown), which might contribute to the sink strength.;  Finally, cytokinins and sugars both control the expression of CYCLIND3 genes, which have been shown to be instrumental for the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle (Riou-Khamlichi et al., 2000) and for symptom development upon R. fascians infection (Depuydt et al., 2009).;  Gene expression data, determination of chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging altogether supported the occurrence of photosynthesis inhibition upon infection with R. fascians.;  Similarly, transcript and metabolite data indicated that the flux through the TCA cycle was also reduced when the disease became fully established, although the concentration of succinate remained high throughout the interaction and pyruvate levels were elevated at the early stages of infection.; Orn and Arg are also precursors of polyamine biosynthesis, and the polyamine putrescine accumulates to high levels during infection.;  This accumulation could be interpreted as a sign of reduced catabolism; polyamine degradation has recently been described as an important source for H2O2 production (Walters, 2003; Cona et al., 2006; Jubault et al., 2008; Kusano et al., 2008, and refs. therein), further supporting the absence of an oxidative burst upon R. fascians infection.;  Trehalose levels increased upon infection with both R. fascians strains, although the effect of D188 was much stronger, and interestingly, trehalose biosynthesis has been reported to be activated by cytokinin application (Brenner et al., 2005).;  Prior to infection, the cultures were washed and concentrated four times by resuspending the bacterial pellets in sterile distilled water.; To assay the activities of the cytosolic, vacuolar, and cell wall invertases, the extraction was carried out as described (Wright et al., 1998), with approximately 150 mg of ground shoot tissue of each infection condition supplemented with 1.2 mL of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)."

Filamentous bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales, especially Micromomospora and Streptomyces strains, have a unique and proven capacity to produce novel antibiotics [2–4], hence the continued interest in screening such organisms for new bioactive metabolites [5, 6]. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to discover commercially significant secondary metabolites from well known actinomycetes as this practice leads to the wasteful rediscovery of known bioactive compounds, thereby emphasizing the need to isolate, characterize and screen reperesentatives of undiscovered actinomycete taxa.; It is perhaps not surprising that novel marine actinomycetes are proving to be such a valuable source of new bioactive compounds [24–26] as actinomycete systematics is providing a taxonomic road map to genes hence products, including the discovery of first-in-class drug candidates [9, 27–29]. Indeed, an encouraging flow of novel anti-infection and anti-cancer compounds are being sourced from marine actinomycetes, as exemplified by the discovery of the abbysomicins, potent polycyclic polyketides active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and produced by “Verrucosispora maris” [30] and salinosporamide A, an anti-cancer compound produced by Salinispora tropica [31]. Marine Verrucosispora strains are also a source of novel proximicins, anti-tumor furan analogues of the antibiotic netropsin [32].;  However, it is clear from the present study that actinomycetes isolated from mangrove habitats can be expected to provide high quality biological material for high through put biochemical, anti-cancer and anti-infection screening programmes."

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infectious agent involved in the development of skin infections that are associated with antibiotic resistance, such as burn wounds.;  Due to antibiotic resistance, S. aureus strains are particularly difficult to eliminate and therefore pose a significant threat in nosocomial infections [2]. S. aureus are common Gram-positive bacteria which belong to the harmless natural microflora that inhabits intact and healthy human skin.;  Search for more effective ways to treat MRSA infections stimulates the investigation of natural compounds as alternative treatment [5].;  As much as the above-mentioned cytotoxic activity observed in vitro is indisputable, studies involving the use of plumbagin in vivo on mice skin revealed no toxicity of plumbagin (5 µM) towards internal organs [27]. As antibiotic resistance of S. aureus is a serious problem in skin infections [28], the proposed new therapeutic agent consisting of the D. binata extract and AgNPs could be intended for further studies on novel therapies treating burn wound infections, impetigo or diabetic foot infections."

The antifungal activity of paenilarvins might also include activity against the nearly ubiquitously occurring bee pathogenic fungus Ascosphaera apis (etiological agent of chalkbrood) [35]. Further experiments are necessary to address the interesting question of the relevance of paenilarvins’ anti-fungal activity during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections."

inflammation,D007249,29113654,5726560," Other bacterial species have been shown to produce short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract.; The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms, which can influence the immune system and health conditions, including cancer [3–5]. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet, lifestyle, and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [6,7]. Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [8,9].; Accumulating evidence indicates that SCFAs such as butyrate, which are produced by the gut microbiota, can suppress colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis by blocking activation of the NFKB signaling pathway and inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing T cells [55–57]. Experimental studies have shown that butyrate can function as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation, stimulate apoptosis, and suppress colonic tumor development [58–61]. In contrast, emerging data demonstrate that low concentrations of butyrate may promote the growth of colonic tumors that exhibit DNA mismatch repair deficiencies in a mouse model [62].; The NLR family is a group of receptor proteins that respond to intracellular fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan and initiate the NFKB and MAPK signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells [67]. Studies have shown that activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) in colonic epithelial cells can induce inflammation through the up-regulation of chemokine CCL5 and promote colorectal tumor development through the up-regulation of IL6 expression in the tumor microenvironment [68,69]. In the mouse model of colorectal cancer liver metastases, NLRP3 in Kuppfer cells increase the production of IL18, which can activate the function of NK cells and suppress colon cancer metastatic growth in the liver [70]. On the other hand, NOD2 can induce microbial dysbiosis and potentiate the development of inflammation-induced colorectal tumors through up-regulation of IL6 expression in colonic epithelial cells, suggesting a protective role for NOD2 in the maintenance of the composition of the gut microbiota [71].;  Studies suggest that enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is detected significantly more often in the colon mucosa tissue or stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls and that a higher amount of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is associated with advanced disease stage [116,128,129]. Although experimental studies suggest that Enterococcus faecalis may promote the development of gastric and colorectal tumors [14–18], one clinical study has suggested that Enterococcus faecalis is detected significantly more often in the stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls [130]. Studies have demonstrated that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus in human colorectal carcinomas is higher than in control tissue and that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus is correlated with the expression of PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in colorectal cancer tissue [131–133]. These findings suggest a potential role of Streptococcus gallolyticus in the development of colorectal tumors through inflammation."

In these settings, antibiotic resistance is a rapidly growing problem, thus there is need for novel therapeutic targets [3], [4]. Acquisition and metabolism of small molecules from the host is an important part of establishment and maintenance of infection [5], [6], [7]. These bacterial pathways define a set of potential – yet largely uncharacterized – targets for drug development.; The importance of PlcH during infection, and the control of plcH transcription by GB activation of GbdR, led us to hypothesize that conversion of host choline to GB would play a role in P. aeruginosa biology during lung infection.;  In this study we have used a mouse model of P. aeruginosa lung infection to understand the contribution of choline catabolism to P. aeruginosa survival during lung infection.; We used the oropharyngeal route of mouse lung infection as we previously described [26].

melanoma,D008545,28923537,5602478,"This is the first prospective study of the effects of human gut microbiota and metabolites on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICT) response in metastatic melanoma patients.;  Whereas many melanoma patients exhibit profound response to ICT, there are fewer options for patients failing ICT—particularly with BRAF-wild-type disease.;  In preclinical studies, specific gut microbiota promotes regression of melanoma in mice.;  We therefore conducted a study of the effects of pretreatment gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response in 39 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IN), or pembrolizumab (P).; Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICT) achieves durable remissions in up to half of patients with metastatic melanoma [1]. However, a substantial number of patients fail to benefit from ICT, and others experience severe autoimmune adverse events including dermatitis, colitis, hepatitis, and hypophysitis [2]. In this setting, investigators have sought to identify host or tumor characteristics that impact ICT response.; There is mounting evidence that gastrointestinal tract bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiota, can influence and modulate host immune responses [7], [8]. In preclinical mouse models, the composition of the host gut microbiota is a major factor determining ICT response [8], [9], [10]. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated tumor-bearing mice do not respond to immune therapy [8]. B16 melanoma–bearing mice treated with Bifidobacterium
spp. show increased tumor DC antitumor immune gene expression and enhanced anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy response [9]. Furthermore, gut commensals Bacteroides thetaiotamicron or B. fragilis are necessary for anti-CTLA4 antibody anti-B16 melanoma in vivo efficacy [10]. DCs and T cells mixed with either of these Bacteroides species in vitro increased T-cell interferon γ production and in vivo tumor growth inhibition.;  In all the above studies, the gut bacteria induced maturation of anti-melanoma DCs and T cells.; Based on these observations, we initiated a study of metastatic melanoma patients initiating ICT.;  We report the ICT efficacy in 39 metastatic melanoma patients and correlate clinical responses with gut microbiota taxonomic profiles, gut metabolite levels, and patient dietary and antibiotic histories.; The study design was a single-site, correlative study of the effects of gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT efficacy in 39 adult melanoma patients.;  We enrolled patients with a histologic diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma that were scheduled to begin ICT and willing to collect stool specimens, store them in a freezer, and deliver them to our facility.; MSS data (mean of 85,339,022 reads per sample; range 39,703,594 to 121,707,762 reads) were generated from sequencing fecal gDNA fragments from adult melanoma patients (n = 44; 39 samples prior to ICT therapy and 5 repeat samples within 1 month of starting ICT) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (100-bp pair-end reads) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Genomics Core Facility.; Thirty-nine metastatic melanoma patients were enrolled, consented, provided pretreatment fecal samples, underwent ICT, and had follow-up exams and scans (Table 1).; MSS identifies specific bacterial species that are enriched in the gut microbiomes of melanoma patients who are responding to ICT therapy.;  Relative abundance of gut bacterial taxa as determined by MetaPhlAn analysis of MSS data generated from fecal specimens collected from melanoma patients prior to receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab alone, or nivolumab alone.; Unbiased metabolomics analysis of stool metabolites from adult melanoma patients prior to treatment with ICT.;  UPLC-MS–based global profiling of metabolites in feces of adult melanoma patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (n = 39).; This is the first detailed report of human gut microbiome metagenomic and metabolomic profiling in melanoma patients treated with combination anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy (IN) as well as anti-PD1 therapy alone (P).;  Carbonnel and colleagues performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool from melanoma patients receiving anti-CTLA4 antibody pretreatment and before each antibody infusion [36]. The bacterial diversity and species abundance were not altered by anti-CTLA4 therapy.;  When bacterial species are combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab in mixed lymphocyte reactions, interleukin-2 and interferon-γ can be measured in the supernatant, providing an indirect assay of DC activation [41]. Furthermore, fulfilling Koch's postulates will require testing the proposed bacteria in antibiotic gut microbiome–depleted C57/BL6 mice with B16/F10 melanoma receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab, as has been successfully applied for testing cGAMP analogs [42]."
melanoma,D008545,28035958,6155896," Moreover, the compound exhibited no cytotoxicity toward mouse melanoma cell lines, B16F1 and B16F10, or the normal cell line, HaCaT.;  UVA (315–400 nm) and UVB (280–315 nm) can pass through the ozone layer and reach the ground, whereas UVC (<280 nm) cannot [1]. It is well known that the long term effects of UV radiation are harmful to human health and that excessive doses can cause photo-aging, inflammation, and malignant skin cancers [2,3,4]. Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that has been increasing in humans worldwide, and it is estimated that about 48,000 people die from melanoma annually.;  To explore the effects of (3R)-5-hydroxymellein on cells, the cytotoxicity of (3R)-5-hydroxymellein against the mouse melanoma cell lines, B16F1 and B16F10, and the normal cell line, HaCaT, were determined.;  The crude extract exhibited low cytotoxic activities against melanoma cell lines B16F1 and B16F10, with IC50 values of 153.8 ± 31.1 and 221.7 ± 40.8 µg/mL, respectively.;  However, for HaCaT cells, the IC50 of crude extract was 28.6 ± 4.2 µg/mL, which indicated higher cytotoxicity than that of melanoma cells.; The cytotoxicity of (3R)-5-hydroxymellein against melanoma cells B16F1 and F10 was not high, indicating that 5-hydoxymellein is not a good anticancer agent.; The B16F1 and B16F10 mouse melanoma cell lines were kindly provided by Professor Hangun Kim, College of Pharmacy, Sunchon National University."

melanoma xenograft tumor,D008545,16988123,1612582, Mice fed the diet containing the highest amount of resveratrol had melanoma xenograft tumors that tended (P = 0.09) to grow faster than mice fed the control diet (Fig. 1A).
melioidosis,D008554,24884988,4091270," The bacterial disease melioidosis
is conferred by the highly virulent, antibiotic-resistant pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP).;  Disruption of Burkholderia virulence by inhibiting the
biosynthesis of these small-molecule biosynthetic pathways may prove
to be an effective strategy for developing novel melioidosis-specific
therapeutics.; Burkholderia
pseudomallei (BP) is the causative agent
for the bacterial septic disease melioidosis.
Melioidosis is endemic throughout the tropical Southeast Pacific region
and is considered a growing global health threat.1BP, an environmental saphrophyte
by nature, is intrinsically resistant to multiple antibiotics due
to factors including drug inactivation (e.g., β-lactamase activity),
a multidrug efflux pump system, and an adaptive physiology that can
alter drug target sites throughout disease progression.2 As a result, mortality rates from melioidosis
can approach ∼50% even with antibiotic treatment.3 Despite increased scrutiny in recent years, the
mechanisms by which BP can establish and propagate
an infection have remained unclear.;  Bioinformatics analyses of BP and its genetic relatives Burkholderia mallei (BM) and Burkholderia thailandensis (BT) indicate that substantial parts of their genomes
are dedicated to polyketide (PK)- and non-ribosomal peptide (NRP)-based
secondary metabolism,4−6 which we have hypothesized could be a key component
of Burkholderia virulence.7−9 While many of the gene clusters
common to all three species have been studied, clusters that are solely
found within the BP genome have remained uncharacterized,
and to date, the specific roles that secondary metabolism has in establishing
melioidosis have not been evaluated.;  We hypothesized that BP-specific cryptic
gene clusters may play an important, and overlooked, role in melioidosis.
To test this hypothesis, we used homologous recombination to delete
the initial biosynthetic domains (detailed in Table S4) within the first either PK or NRP megasynth(et)ase
gene of clusters 2, 11, 14, and 15, thereby creating four strains
with individually disrupted biosynthetic gene clusters.;  Additionally,
the identification and characterization of small molecules encoded
by cryptic gene clusters associated with virulence, especially when
studying highly controlled Select Agent pathogens like BP, provide a means to potentially more safely dissect the detailed
mechanisms of melioidosis.;  Proteasome inhibition
is known to directly activate programmed cell death through induction
of apoptosis and autophagy across multiple cell lines, including macrophages.28−31 In the context of BP infections, autophagy has
been shown to be critical for diverting host nutrients to the pathogen.32 Proteasome inhibition by the glidobactins
could therefore provide the mechanistic explanation for both promoting
intracellular replication or, in the case of macrophages, immunosuppression,
which has long been suspected within BP pathogenicity.33 In light of the importance of these small molecules
to BP pathogenesis, the inhibition of their biosyntheses
could prove to be a productive avenue for the development of next-generation
therapeutics for combating melioidosis."
mortality,D003643,27795310,5165121," Extracts and fractions were also shown to inhibit coral larval settlement and cause mortality at concentrations lower (<0.3 mg · ml−1) than calculated natural concentrations (4.4 mg · ml−1).;  This study contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that macroalgae play a critical role in shifting the coral holobiont equilibrium, which may promote the invasion of opportunistic pathogens and cause coral mortality, facilitating additional macroalgal growth and invasion in the reef.;  Direct contact between macroalgae and corals has been implicated in reduced coral growth and fecundity, bleaching, tissue necrosis, mortality, and disease (7,–15).;  Macroalgae have also been shown to indirectly induce and inhibit coral larval settlement (16, 17), both of which are likely to result in larval mortality via poor substratum choice (e.g., shading, overgrowth, and ephemeral growth), mechanical damage (e.g., algal abrasion), or allelochemical defenses.;  Numerous studies have shown that shifts in microbial community composition can be detrimental to coral health and may predispose corals to bleaching, infection, and mortality (26, 27).;  Barott and Rohwer (23) outlined the dissolved organic material (DOM), disease, algae, and microbes (DDAM) model, a feedback loop in which DOM released from macroalgae disrupts coral holobiont function and promotes the invasion of opportunistic pathogens and coral mortality, facilitating additional macroalgal growth and invasion in the reef.;  AC was detrimental to Acropora millepora coral larval metamorphosis (i.e., larvae attaching to the bottom and reaching the coral polyp stage at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg · ml−1), with significant mortality (i.e., nonmotile larvae with signs of degradation) observed at concentrations of ≥0.3 mg · ml−1 (Fig. 6A).;  Across all treatment concentrations, larvae exposed to OC had significantly less mortality (average ± SD, 8.2% ± 6.1%) than those treated with the AC (average ± SD, 13.3% ± 13.3%), potentially due to the solubility of AC versus OC extracts (Fig. 6A and ​andB).B).;  Dried (lyophilized) Lobophora sp. blades, washed in seawater for 5 h to remove the majority of surface-associated DOM, exhibited larval metamorphosis activity similar to that observed in crustose coralline algae (CCA) controls and plastic mimic controls, with virtually no mortality (Fig. 6C).;  Nonwashed blades of Lobophora sp. caused >50% larval mortality and a 60% reduction in metamorphosis, declining from 92% in CCA controls to 37% with nonwashed (NW) Lobophora sp. blades (Fig. 6C).; A recent long-term study demonstrated over 3 years that overfishing and nutrient pollution can cause an increase in turf and macroalgal cover, which in turn destabilizes coral microbiomes, elevates putative pathogen loads, and significantly increases coral disease and mortality (58).;  Thus, allelochemical stress caused by encroaching macroalgae may elicit a community-wide destabilization of the microbiome, shift to pathogen dominance, and ultimately coral disease and/or mortality.;  The OC extract generally resulted in reduced mortality, in comparison to the more soluble AC extract, which was cytotoxic to >60% of the larvae at equivalent concentrations.;  Experiments with lyophilized and briefly rinsed algal blades caused ∼50% mortality, but more rigorous washing of the blades in seawater reduced mortality to 0%, suggesting that the cytotoxicity is likely due to water-soluble compounds.; A series of coral larval settlement assays were conducted with Acropora millepora larvae to assess whether Lobophora sp. extracts and fractions resulted in a higher occurrence of mortality or induced/inhibited larval metamorphosis."
mortality,D003643,25044543,4234257," Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death.;  We propose that Pam, although not essential for larval mortality, is a virulence factor of P. larvae influencing the time course of disease.; Total mortality was depicted as mean values ± SD and statistically analyzed by Student's t-test.;  Surprisingly, total mortality did not differ significantly between the groups infected with wild-type or mutant bacteria (Fig.​(Fig.7A).7A).;  Daily mortality due to P. larvae infection was recorded and total mortality was calculated.;  No significant difference in total mortality was observed. (B) Daily mortality due to P. larvae infection was recorded and cumulative mortality was calculated.;  Larvae infected with DSM25430 ΔpamA died as fast as larvae that had been infected with wild-type bacteria, however, onset of larval dying was delayed resulting in a significant parallel shift of the cumulative mortality curve to the right.;  Curves represent mean cumulative mortality ± SD for each day of three replicas with 30 larvae each.; Analyzing the time course of infection revealed that the curve for cumulative mortality was shifted to the right for the groups infected with the mutant strain (Fig.​(Fig.7B)7B) indicating that in these groups the onset of larval dying was significantly delayed in comparison to the groups infected with wild-type bacteria (P = 0.028; two-way ANOVA).;  These results suggested that Pam although not influencing total mortality influenced the time course of disease and, hence, can be considered a virulence factor.;  Gene disruption in these toxin genes led to a significant reduction in mortality indicating that they are virulence factors and play an important role during pathogenesis (Fünfhaus et al. 2013).;  If the function of Pam were to act as cytotoxin during infection and to help breaching the epithelial cell layer (Yue et al. 2008) we would have expected a similar significant reduction in total mortality in the absence of this toxin, especially because so far no toxin gene has been identified in this strain (Djukic et al. 2014).;  Instead, absence or presence of Pam production did not make a difference in total mortality but instead a delay in the onset of larval dying was observed in those larvae that were infected with the mutant bacteria.;  However, in larvae infected by P. larvae lacking Pam production a delayed onset of larval mortality by unaltered total mortality could be observed in comparison to larvae infected by wild-type bacteria."

multiple bacterial infections,D001424,21116414,2993000," Some of these bioactive secondary metabolites of microbial origin with strong antibacterial and antifungal activities are being intensely used as antibiotics and may be effective against infectious diseases such as HIV, conditions of multiple bacterial infections (penicillin, cephalosporines, streptomycin, and vancomycin) or neuropsychiatric sequelae.;  These metabolites, otherwise known as bioactive substances, are profoundly used as antibiotics and may be effective against infectious diseases such as HIV-1 [1]; conditions of multiple bacterial infections (penicillin, cephalosporines, streptomycin, and vancomycin); or neural tube defects and neuropsychiatric sequelae [2,3]. Some drugs have also been found to be useful against carcinomas (bleomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin and staurosporin), risk of coronary heart disease, or may act as immune-suppressants (cyclosporin) to aid in organ transplantation [4]; thus making the microbial secondary metabolites an enormous source of pharmaceutical importance."

neurodegeneration,D019636,19806188,2751819,"Parkinson disease (PD) involves progressive neurodegeneration, including loss of dopamine (DA) neurons from the substantia nigra.;  Here we demonstrate that a metabolite produced by a common soil bacterium, S. venezuelae, caused DA neurodegeneration in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which increased as animals aged.;  The presence of DA exacerbated toxicity because neurodegeneration was attenuated in mutant nematodes depleted for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA production.; Here we show that common soil bacteria of a distinct Streptomyces species produce a secondary metabolite that causes neurodegeneration.; When considering potential environmental sources of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative disorders, we were intrigued by reports that described DA neurodegeneration and PD-like symptoms following direct injection of proteasome inhibitors into rat brains [10], [11]. This prompted us to initially determine if exposure to proteasome inhibitors could cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans.;  Worms expressing GFP specifically in DA neurons (Pdat-1::GFP) [12] were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for a total of eight days and DA neurodegeneration was scored every two days, as previously described [13]. MG-132 caused a progressive loss of DA neurons (Fig. 1); after eight days of exposure, 23% of worms displayed DA degeneration compared with 3% of worms exposed to the DMSO vehicle (P<0.001).; An isogenic worm strain expressing GFP in DA neurons was examined for DA neurodegeneration every two days.;  Significant DA neurodegeneration occurred after eight days of continuous exposure to MG-132 in comparison to the solvent control (*P<0.05; ANOVA).;  All data in this figure are represented as mean worms with neurodegeneration +/− S.E.M.; Since worms displayed DA neurodegeneration in response to a purified proteasome inhibitor, we considered possible sources of naturally occurring exposures.;  We therefore examined the potential for secondary metabolites of common soil bacteria, Streptomyces species (S. coelicolor, S. griseus, and S. venezuelae), to cause DA neurodegeneration in C. elegans.;  For example, after six days of exposure to S. venezuelae conditioned medium, 27% of worms displayed DA neurodegeneration.;  An isogenic worm strain expressing GFP in DA neurons was examined for DA neurodegeneration four and six days after exposure to Streptomyces spp. conditioned media.;  Significant DA neurodegeneration only occurred from exposure to S. venezuelae conditioned medium (*P<0.05; ANOVA).;  C. Populations of isogenic worm strains expressing GFP exclusively in 5-HT, GABA, ACh, Glut, and DA (+ and –TH) neuronal classes were examined for neurodegeneration.;  The only animals that displayed significant neurodegeneration after six days exposure to S. venezuelae conditioned medium were those in which the DA (+TH) neurons were analyzed (*P<0.01; ANOVA).;  Specifically, ≤5% of worms displayed 5-HT, GABA, ACh, or Glut neurodegeneration, compared with 22% of worms exhibiting DA neurodegeneration at day six (P<0.01; data standardized with E. coli conditioned medium control).;  To explore the possibility that the C. elegans DA transporter, DAT-1 might facilitate entry of the S. venezuelae factor, dat-1 mutant worms expressing GFP in DA neurons (dat-1; Pdat-1::GFP), which are deficient for DAT-1 [13], [22], were examined for neurodegeneration in response to the factor.;  After six days of exposure to S. venezuelae conditioned medium there was no significant difference in DA neurodegeneration between WT and dat-1 worms (24±1.3% vs. 29±4.4% worms with DA neurodegeneration, respectively).; Since DA neurons degenerate more readily than other neuronal classes, we hypothesized that the presence of DA itself might enhance the neurodegeneration associated with exposures.;  Notably, when examining the comparative loss of individual neurons after eight days of exposure to S. venezuelae medium (Fig. 2D), only 3% of DA (-TH) neurons within cat-2 worms exhibited DA neurodegeneration compared with 17% of DA neurons in wild-type worms (P<0.01).;  Therefore, the presence of DA appears to provide a sensitized cellular milieu for the S. venezuelae factor that exacerbates neurodegeneration.; Several mechanisms associated with intracellular stress and neurodegeneration could be influenced by the S. venezuelae factor.;  These cells were exposed to conditioned media from S. venezuelae or S. coelicolor, the latter of which did not cause significant neurodegeneration in C. elegans neurons.;  Specifically, 20% vs. 18% of worms displayed DA neurodegeneration after six days exposure to heat-treated and untreated factor, respectively (Fig. 8A).;  Likewise, proteinase K digestion did not alter the activity; 15% worms exhibited DA neurodegeneration after exposure to the treated S. venezuelae factor (vs. 18% of worms exposed to untreated factor; Fig. 8A).;  All data in this figure are represented as percentage of mean worms exhibiting DA neurodegeneration.;  The amount of DA neurodegeneration observed in the conditioned media control was lower than previously reported because 34% less factor was used in each experiment (to ensure final ethyl acetate concentrations were below 1.5%).; We have begun chemical characterization of the neurotoxic metabolite and have tested the product from each stage of the purification process for DA neurodegeneration using C. elegans.;  Once we have identified the chemical structure of the factor, this will assist with a further understanding of the mechanism by which it is causing neurodegeneration in C. elegans or SH-SY5Y cells, and will facilitate development of in vivo mammalian models.; Onset and progression of PD appears to converge at the intersection between environmental influences, intrinsic DA metabolism, and accumulation of misfolded proteins to yield enhanced susceptibility to neurodegeneration over the course of time.;  Increasing evidence supports deficits in, or inhibition of protein degradation and clearance pathways by either genetic or environmental factors as impacting neurodegeneration [9]. Indeed, a balance exists between proteasome function and autophagy or lysosomal-based degradation as complementary and compensatory mechanisms to mediate clearance of misfolded proteins [34], [35]. It is intriguing to consider that even mild toxin-mediated UPS inhibition may combine with genetic deficit in select autophagy genes to yield enhanced susceptibility to neurodegeneration.;  Support for a “multiple hit” hypothesis for induction of neurodegeneration in PD has recently come from an elegant study indicating that increased cytosolic DA levels influence neurotoxicity through generation of oxidized metabolites that interact with α-synuclein, an effect that is blocked by calcium channel blockers [36]. We previously showed that overexpression of the C. elegans TH homolog, CAT-2, in nematode DA neurons also led to increased neurodegeneration, an effect that was blocked by 3-iodotyrosine treatment (13).;  Given the substantial neuroprotective impact of TH mutants on the toxicity caused by the Streptomyces metabolite in C. elegans, it is interesting to speculate this environmental factor may represent an added multifactoral component in DA neurodegeneration.; Several prior studies have reported selective loss of DA neurons after systemic administration of lactacystin or PSI to rodents [10], [37], [38], but other investigators have had difficulty reproducing these results [39], [40]. Direct administration of either of these agents into the brain, however, leads to a reliable and consistent progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons [11], [41]. It has also recently been demonstrated that genetic depletion of the 26S proteasome subunit results in protein inclusions and neurodegeneration in mice [42]. In this latter report, conditional knockout in targeted brain neurons of mice clearly demonstrates a role for proteasome function in neuronal homeostasis and survival.;  Additional work to define the intracellular target(s) of this toxin will likely reveal more about the mechanism underlying neurodegeneration.;  Follow-up studies showed that N. asteroides strain GUH-2 was neuroinvasive in the brains of mice [44], [45] and monkeys [46] and that infection resulted in apoptotic death of DA neurons associated with proteasome inhibition [47], [48]. Another nocardial strain (GAM-5) has also been shown to induce impaired movements and similar pathological features in mice following sublethal infection [49]. Characterization of culture filtrates from strain GUH-2 indicated that a non-lipid, small molecular weight, secreted substance may be responsible for DA-depleting effects [50]. While the chemical profile of the S. venezualae neurotoxic factor is distinct from the nocardial metabolite, taken together, these reports emphasize the potential impact of bacterial exposures on neurodegeneration.;  We empirically determined that 2 days of exposure resulted in proteasome inhibition without corresponding to DA neurodegeneration (see Fig. 1).;  After six days of continuous exposure to the conditioned medium SYZ medium, 27% of worms displayed DA neurodegeneration, while only 6%, 4%, 7%, and 6% of worms exhibited DA neurodegeneration following exposure to NGM, NGM with sorbitol, NB and BHI media, respectively.;  The organic phases were pooled and dried [31]. The dried extract were weighed and resuspended (3 mg/ml) in ethyl acetate for worm DA neurodegeneration assays, which were performed blinded.;  DA neurodegeneration in C. elegans was assayed as described previously."

neurotoxic,D020258,19806188,2751819," Thus, an unmet challenge surrounds the discovery of causal or contributory neurotoxic factors that could account for the prevalence of sporadic PD.;  Evidence of a robust neurotoxic factor that selectively impacts neuronal survival in a progressive yet moderate manner is consistent with the etiology of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.; When considering potential environmental sources of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative disorders, we were intrigued by reports that described DA neurodegeneration and PD-like symptoms following direct injection of proteasome inhibitors into rat brains [10], [11]. This prompted us to initially determine if exposure to proteasome inhibitors could cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans.;  We therefore conclude that the neurotoxic S. venezuelae metabolite is not specifically entering DA neurons through the DAT-1 transporter.;  Therefore, we conclude that the S. venezuelae conditioned medium contains a neurotoxic activity that blocks the UPS.;  These data confirm that the S. venezuelae neurotoxic activity characterized in the C. elegans model also has the capacity to cause degeneration of human DA-producing neurons.; We have begun chemical characterization of the neurotoxic metabolite and have tested the product from each stage of the purification process for DA neurodegeneration using C. elegans.;  Support for a “multiple hit” hypothesis for induction of neurodegeneration in PD has recently come from an elegant study indicating that increased cytosolic DA levels influence neurotoxicity through generation of oxidized metabolites that interact with α-synuclein, an effect that is blocked by calcium channel blockers [36]. We previously showed that overexpression of the C. elegans TH homolog, CAT-2, in nematode DA neurons also led to increased neurodegeneration, an effect that was blocked by 3-iodotyrosine treatment (13).;  This is significant to consider in the context of our findings showing that our neurotoxic factor inhibits proteasome activity of C. elegans DA neurons.;  Although a putative route of environmental exposures to humans remains undefined, the small size and stability of the bacterial metabolite we have identified suggests a robust neurotoxic capacity.;  Follow-up studies showed that N. asteroides strain GUH-2 was neuroinvasive in the brains of mice [44], [45] and monkeys [46] and that infection resulted in apoptotic death of DA neurons associated with proteasome inhibition [47], [48].

While the chemical profile of the S. venezualae neurotoxic factor is distinct from the nocardial metabolite, taken together, these reports emphasize the potential impact of bacterial exposures on neurodegeneration.;  Nevertheless, in the context of our findings with more common non-pathogenic bacterial species, a prospective role for bacterial metabolites as environmental effectors of neurotoxicity is understudied and should perhaps be revisited.;  Moreover, the progressive nature of PD is reflected in the moderate and age-associated gradated degeneration we observed in response to the Streptomyces neurotoxic metabolite in C. elegans and warrants further investigation in mammalian in vivo models.;  In this regard, surveys of strain-specific effects, chronic vs. acute exposure paradigms, and community-based epidemiological analyses are all required to better define the impact of bacterial sources of neurotoxicity."

obesity,D009765,28936425,5596107," Gut dysbiosis might result in obesity, diabetes, gastrointestinal, immunological, and neurobehavioral disorders.;  As illustrated in Figure ​Figure1,1, the gut microbiome changes could thus be secondary to phenotypic changes in the host, including metabolic disorders (obesity/weight loss, inappetence, gastrointestinal disorders, and growth defects to list a few examples).;  For instance, obesity, starvation, and gastrointestinal disorders could directly affect nutrient substrate availability within the gastrointestinal system and thereby shift proliferation to certain bacterial communities (Sweeney and Morton, 2013; Astbury et al., 2015; Remely et al., 2015; Jonkers, 2016; Nettleton et al., 2016; Hoffman et al., 2017; Seganfredo et al., 2017).;  Some of the environmental chemicals discussed below, namely bisphenol A (BPA), are associated with inducing metabolic disorders and obesity, and are therefore considered obesogens (Johnson et al., 2015; Janesick and Blumberg, 2016; Heindel et al., 2017).;  Examples of such host changes include hormonal imbalances, obesity, inappetence, gastrointestinal disease, or growth.;  In pregnant women, the gut microbiota profile, especially relative amounts of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, are associated with leukocyte DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in lipid metabolism and obesity (Kumar et al., 2014)."

periodontitis,D010518,26477831,4609958," Here we applied a real-time mass spectrometric technique to investigate differences in volatile metabolic profiles of oral bacteria that cause periodontitis.;  In a second proof-of-principle phase, we found 18 (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola) of the 120 in vitro compounds in the saliva from a periodontitis patient with confirmed infection with P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola with enhanced ion intensity compared to two healthy controls.;  Often, patients suffering of periodontitis only show indicating symptoms at a late stage, when the development of the disease has led to enhanced tooth mobility.;  In a second phase, we tested whether the set of molecules found to be discriminatory in the in vitro study could also be found in saliva samples from one periodontitis patient.;  The patient suffered a severe periodontitis, and P. gingivalis, T. denticola and T. forsythia bacteria were present.;  While the number of participants in this study is limited, the fact that 18 molecules are systematically detected both in in vitro cultures and enhanced in the saliva of a patient suffering periodontitis, supports the hypothesis that pathogen-related volatiles could be used as indicators of periodontitis development.;  The 120 most discriminative compounds found in vitro were then used for targeted analysis of the saliva samples from a severe periodontitis patient and two healthy controls.;  We conclude that this method has potential for clinical diagnosis of bacterial infections in the oral cavity such as periodontitis.;  One patient with severe periodontitis and two healthy controls were selected for the explorative targeted analysis of the human saliva samples.;  The participants were examined for their periodontitis status by a dentist."

pigmented,D010859,15006783,368400," In selectivity experiments with nontoxic Pseudomonas putida MM1, flagellates did not discriminate against pigmented strains.;  An AHL-deficient, nonpigmented mutant provided high flagellate growth rates, while the addition of the natural C. violaceum AHL could restore toxicity.;  In many experiments with enhanced protozoan grazing pressure, we observed an accumulation of pigmented strains in the bacterial community (C.;  This mutant is nonpigmented unless provided with exogenous AHL.; A series of batch culture experiments was performed to examine the population response of the flagellates to the presence of J. lividum CM37, the wild-type C. violaceum CV0, the violacein-overproducing mutant CV017, the nonpigmented strain CV026, and nontoxic P. putida MM1.;  While cells of the wild-type CV0 and the hyperpigmented mutant CV017 showed a steady increase in violacein content over a 4-day period, no pigment production was detected in the case of the AHL-deficient strain CV026 (data not shown).;  The three strains were similar in cell size but differed significantly in their violacein content per cell (P < 0.002; Table ​Table2):2): Pigmentation was highest for strain CV017, while strain CV026 remained nonpigmented.; The influence of bacterial violacein content on flagellate survival was tested on 1:1 mixtures of the nontoxic P. putida MM1 and the wild-type C. violaceum CV0, the hyperpigmented strain CV017, and the nonpigmented strain CV026.;  When grazing on the nonpigmented CV026, Ochromonas sp. exhibited a distinct increase in cell numbers by 45% to 13.8 × 104 flagellates ml−1 within the first 3 h of the experiment (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3).;  The strongest decrease in flagellate abundance was observed on the hyperpigmented CV017.;  The wild-type C. violaceum CV0, the hyperpigmented strain CV017, and the nonpigmented strain CV026 were offered in 1:1 mixtures with nontoxic P. putida MM1.; We tested the impact of violacein-producing cells on growth and survival of two bacterivorous nanoflagellates in an otherwise nontoxic prey assortment by offering four different food ratios of the pigmented strain CV017 and nontoxic P. putida MM1.;  Lovejoy et al.

pigmented,D010859,21342469,3818864," In Streptomyces coelicolor, a group of signalling molecules called SCBs (S. coelicolorbutanolides) regulates production of the pigmented antibiotics coelicolor polyketide (CPK), actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin.;  We report a strong perturbation in the expression of three pigmented antibiotic clusters in the mutant throughout the growth curve, thus providing a molecular explanation for the antibiotic phenotype observed previously.;  SCBs are known to regulate at least three antibiotic biosynthetic clusters: act, for the synthesis of the blue‐pigmented actinorhodin (Act); red, for the synthesis of the red‐pigmented undecylprodigiosin (Red); and the recently characterized cpk for the synthesis of the yellow pigment yCPK and the antibiotic abCPK (Takano et al., 2005;Gottelt et al., 2010).;  While the wild type started producing the red‐pigmented undecylprodigiosin at time point 3 (TP3) (red bar in Fig. 1), at the switch from exponential to transition phase, followed by the blue pigmented actinorhodin, production of Red in the mutant occurred during exponential phase at TP2 (red bar in Fig. 1).;  In addition to undecylprodigiosin, scbA mutant M751 overproduced the blue‐pigmented actinorhodin, also consistent with an earlier report (Takano et al., 2001)."

pigmented,D010859,28095778,5240218," These sequences were used to reconstruct the largest Pseudoalteromonas pangenome computed so far, including also the two main groups of Pseudoalteromonas strains (pigmented and not pigmented strains).; Representatives of the genus Pseudoalteromonas are also able to produce a broad array of bioactive molecules (among which antibiotics, toxins/antitoxins, antitumor agents) and wide-spectrum enzymes with high specificity at low temperatures [18–20]. These molecules represent an interesting and important evolutionary strategy, since they are responsible for inhibitory interactions among bacteria inhabiting the same environment, to preserve limited resources (e.g. space and nutrients) [21]. Such interactions effectively shape the microbial community composition [22]; in particular, it has been shown that Antarctic sponges host specific bacterial communities whose members are able to inhibit the growth of bacteria inhabiting different sponges [23]. It has been shown that some representatives of the main Pseudoalteromonas clades (pigmented and non-pigmented) display differential degrees of bioactivity, in that pigmented strains are generally more active against a broad spectrum of organisms [24, 25]. Although the non-pigmented strains generally have a minor bioactivity, those inhabiting extreme environments (such as Antarctica) have evolved adaptive mechanisms to cope with adverse conditions, resulting in competitive advantages.;  The light blue shaded area marks the strains assigned to the P. haloplanktis-like group; the strain names and nodes are colored according to the literature records (when available) about the pigmentation: strains with a red name are reported to be pigmented, where those with a blue name are non-pigmented.; One remarkable characteristic of the Pseudoalteromonas genus is that it can be divided in two major clades, including the pigmented strains, with a greater bioactivity, and non-pigmented strains, which tend to have more unusual enzymatic activities [24, 25, 28]. Notably, in the reported phylogeny there is a clear distinction between pigmented and non-pigmented strains: i) the pigmented clade displays a phylogeny with a greater degree of variability, embedding most of the species included in the dataset; ii) the non-pigmented clade is characterized by a phylogenetic shallowness, consistently with the literature and, since it mostly embeds strains from the P. haloplanktis species (as well as strains of the P. undina, P. marina, P. arctica species and still unassigned strains), it will be referred to as P. haloplanktis group (P. h. -group).;  In this work we analyzed and compared the pangenome of: i) the Pseudoalteromonas genus, ii) the group of pigmented strains and, iii) the P. h. group.;  The section a of this figure reports the number of genes in each pangenome category for: the pangenome of the Pseudoalteromonas genus, the pigmented and the P.h. –group.;  For the pigmented and P.h. –group, the dashed line represents the projection of the curve fit up to 38 genomes.; Interestingly, the proportion of dispensable genes is relatively high compared to available pangenomes from other taxa [30, 31]. If this might be expected on the basis of the variability of the genome size of pigmented strains and the whole set of Pseudoalteromonas genomes (Table 1), this might be in disagreement with the shallowness exhibited by the P. h.-group.; The finding that the γ value of the three pangenomes is greater than zero (0.66, 0.46 and 0.46 for the entire Pseudoalteromonas genus, the pigmented strains and the P.h.-group, respectively) indicates that they are open.; The comparative analysis of data obtained for the three groups revealed that the pangenome of the whole genus embeds a more heterogeneous group of organisms than that of the pigmented group and/or P. h.-group; its rarefaction curves has a “more open” trend (γ value of 0.66).;  However, the pangenome of the P. h.-group was larger than that of pigmented strains (17,297 gene families vs. 12,289).;  Indeed, these phylogenetically related strains display a remarkable heterogeneity in terms of gene content, which is comparable to that of the group of pigmented representatives of multiple species (γ value of 0.46).;  For instance, considering the genes related to Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), the pangenomes of pigmented strains and P. h. -group embed comparable number of genes associated to this category in the three pangenome sections, where the core genes are the most represented.;  To verify this hypothesis, the core genes of the P. h. group and the pigmented group were compared, revealing that all the pigmented strains share a pool of genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and degradation of glycogen (i.e.;  The most remarkable difference is observed for the COG category L (replication, recombination and DNA repair), also including genes involved in HGT events, which is enriched for the unique genes of the P. h.-group (15%), compared with the unique genes of the pangenome of the genus (7%) and the pigmented group (3%).;  Indeed, we identified a strong similarity between the two dendrograms, in that the P. h. -group (embedding the non-pigmented strains) is clearly separated from the strains of the pigmented group.;  P. spongiae, P. tunicata, P. haloplanktis ATCC, as well as the pigmented strains) have recently gained a large number of genes.;  In particular, while most of the strains have a similar number of biosynthetic operons (from 1 to 4), the genomes of five pigmented strains (P. citrea NCIMB1889, P. rubra ATCC29570, P. piscicida JCM20779, Pseudoalteromonas sp.;  Indeed, a large variability of the inhibition carried out by different strains was observed by Holmstrom et al. [54], with the pigmented strains (P. citrea, P. rubra and P. tunicata) showing the largest inhibition.;  Thus, the results we obtained might explain the inhibition differences between strains, in that the pigmented strains are, in theory, able to produce a wider array of bioactive molecules, since they have a larger number of operons.;  Although some of these genes were present in the Pseudoalteromonas LCA, the majority of these genes have been acquired through recent events, especially in the pigmented strains.; Considering their pigmentation, the 38 strains under study can be classified in two major groups: one embedding 10 strains (pigmented group) and the other containing 28 strains (P. h.-group), most of which isolated from different ecological niches of Antarctica.;  From a phylogenetic point of view, the pigmented group displays a greater degree of variability, whereas the non-pigmented one is characterized by a phylogenetic shallowness.;  This is remarkable for the non-pigmented strains, since this is in apparent contrast with the phylogenetic shallowness.; The evolutionary events leading to the acquisition and loss of a gene were estimated using a maximum parsimony approach [68]. The phylogenetic tree here reported, rooted using the pigmented clade as outgroup, was used as a guide tree.;  We also reported the equations with the estimated parameter values (Complete curve equations) for the pangenome of the genus (1), the pigmented strains (2) and the P.h.-group (3).

pneumonia,D011014,27404808,4939601," Here we demonstrate that Carolacton, a myxobacterial secondary metabolite previously shown to damage Streptococcus mutans biofilms, inhibits planktonic growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of serotype 19A at nanomolar concentrations.;  S. mutans requires the eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase PknB and the cysteine metabolism regulator CysR for susceptibility to Carolacton, whereas their homologues are not needed in S. pneumoniae, suggesting a specific function for S. mutans biofilms only.;  A bactericidal effect of Carolacton was observed for S. pneumoniae TIGR4, with a reduction of cell numbers by 3 log units.;  The clinical pneumonia isolate Sp49 showed immediate growth arrest and cell lysis, suggesting a bacteriolytic effect of Carolacton.; To investigate these hypotheses and to understand the mode of action of Carolacton in more detail, we studied the response of S. pneumoniae to Carolacton and compared it with that of S. mutans.;  S. pneumoniae is a ubiquitous colonizer of the nasopharynx14 whose carriers usually remain asymptomatic.;  Particularly the prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains of serotype 19A has increased drastically from 5% in the mid-1990’s to up to 48% in 200817.; In this study, we focused on S. pneumoniae TIGR4 as an extensively characterized strain19.;  We investigated growth inhibition by Carolacton of MDR and XDR clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae classified as serotype 19A.;  To clarify if S. pneumoniae shares the molecular target of Carolacton with S. mutans, we tested its sensitivity against 9-epi-Carolacton.;  Therefore, their homologues in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 were deleted and their response to Carolacton determined.;  Finally we investigated the transcriptome, including small regulatory RNAs, of Carolacton-treated cultures of S. pneumoniae TIGR4, constructed knock-out mutants of strongly differentially expressed genes and tested their susceptibility.;  Our data demonstrate that Carolacton acts via the same molecular target in S. mutans and S. pneumoniae.;  Finally, the inhibition of growth of S. pneumoniae by Carolacton shows the characteristics of bactericidal and in some cases even bacteriolytic antibiotics.; Carolacton (0.25 μg/ml final concentration) was added to cultures of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 prior to the onset of the exponential phase (OD600 = 0.15, termed “t0”).;  Since S. pneumoniae autolyzes after reaching the stationary phase22, final cell densities after 24 h were very low and almost the same in treated and untreated cultures.;  For S. pneumoniae TIGR4, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Carolacton was 0.06 μg/ml (Table 1).; (A) The growth curve indicates a growth inhibition of planktonically growing cells of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 by Carolacton at a final concentration of 0.25 μg/ml.; To investigate the effectiveness of Carolacton treatment on S. pneumoniae strains found in pneumococcal disease, three different recent clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, representing drug resistant serotype 19A strains (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1), were subjected to Carolacton susceptibility testing.;  Isolate Sp49 had been obtained from the blood of a septic pneumonia patient and was resistant against two classes of antibiotics.;  The clinical pneumonia isolate (Sp49) was most sensitive and showed a different behaviour from TIGR4: it started to die immediately and after 2 h its OD was lower than at t0, suggesting a bacteriolytic effect of Carolacton (Fig. 2A).;  These results indicate that Carolacton inhibits growth of clinical S. pneumoniae isolates with varying efficiency.;  Interestingly, growth inhibition was weaker in the pleuritis isolate Sp61 and in the non-invasive isolate Sp64, which elicit multiple resistances to antibiotics compared to the pneumonia isolate.; Growth inhibition of pneumococcal clinical isolates Sp49 (pneumonia/sepsis isolate, (A)), Sp61 (pleuritis isolate, (B)) and Sp64 (mid ear isolate, (C)) in THBY.;  Likewise, 0.25 μg/ml epi-Carolacton, a concentration which is generally applied in our growth experiments with streptococci, did not inhibit growth of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 (Fig. 3B).;  Due to the stereospecificity of this interaction we suggest that the cellular target of Carolacton is likely to be identical between S. mutans and S. pneumoniae, in spite of the differences of their physiological responses.;  The S. pneumoniae genome encodes stkP (sp_1732) as corresponding homologue to S. mutans pknB.;  Therefore, the role of the homologue of PknB in S. pneumoniae, StkP, in Carolacton susceptibility of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 was tested.; (A) Immunoblot analysis with StkP-specific antibodies of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 and TIGR4ΔstkP confirms absence of StkP-expression in the TIGR4ΔstkP deletion mutant.;  The CysR homologue (SP_0927) was deleted in S. pneumoniae and tested for susceptibility to Carolacton.;  Thus, the pneumococcal homologues to both proteins mediating the susceptibility to Carolacton in S. mutans, StkP and CysR, are most likely not directly involved in the Carolacton response in S. pneumoniae, in spite of the presumably conserved molecular target of Carolacton in those two species.;  In order to confirm this hypothesis, the effect of Carolacton on membrane integrity and membrane potential of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 was analysed.;  Membrane damage of S. pneumoniae cells was similarly determined by LIVE/DEAD staining during exponential and stationary phase, 3 h and 6 h after addition of Carolacton, respectively.;  Heat-killed S. pneumoniae cells were included as a control and a calibration curve was recorded using flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.;  No indication of S. pneumoniae cell death by Carolacton treatment was detected (Supplementary Fig.; We analysed the transcriptome of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 cells growing with Carolacton starting 5 min after addition of the drug, until 3 h after Carolacton addition.; None of the 58 tRNAs of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 were significantly differentially expressed after Carolacton treatment (Supplementary Fig.; RNA-seq data was analysed for differential expression of 1985 large (>200 nt) and 120 small (≤200 nt) transcripts of S. pneumoniae TIGR4, accounting for 2105 protein-coding genes (Supplementary Dataset 2).;  Therefore, single deletion mutants of sp_0119 and sp_0120 and a Δsp_0119-sp_0120 double mutant were constructed in S. pneumoniae TIGR4.;  Therefore, the RNA-seq data obtained in this study were compared to microarray data previously obtained for Carolacton-treated S. mutans biofilm cells10. 22.8% of all genes were differentially transcribed at 180 min in S. pneumoniae at a log2FC of ≥ ± 0.8 (Supplementary Fig.;  S8 shows a direct comparison between log2FC of the most strongly differentially expressed genes in S. mutans compared to their homologues in S. pneumoniae.;  For example, upregulation of the ComDE two-component system (TCS) for genetic competence is observed in both species, but stronger and earlier in S. pneumoniae, and might represent a general stress response29.;  In S. pneumoniae, transcription of these genes showed a different pattern, indicating that their regulation in S. mutans might be related to the membrane damage occurring at later stages of biofilm growth.;  In S. pneumoniae TIGR4, neither sortase A (srtA, sp_1218) nor its three sortase paralogs (srtBCD, sp_0466-sp_0468)30 were differentially transcribed.;  Also in contrast to S. mutans, the VicKRX TCS was not differentially expressed upon Carolacton treatment in S. pneumoniae.;  In S. mutans, cell wall metabolism-related genes were upregulated, while the respective homologues in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 were not significantly differentially expressed.; Interestingly, the gidA homologue of S. mutans (smu_2141) was among the most strongly upregulated transcripts like in S. pneumoniae, although its upregulation was weaker and occurred later than in the pneumococcus (Supplementary Fig.; Taken together, the transcriptional response of S. mutans and S. pneumoniae to Carolacton appears to be a pleiotropic stress response, different between species, and not a specific and focused transcriptional response as assumed after studies with S. mutans before10.; For the first time we report on the physiological effect of Carolacton on the clinically relevant human pathogen S. pneumoniae.;  Growth of planktonic cultures of S. pneumoniae is already inhibited by Carolacton at a concentration as low as 0.025 μg/ml (Supplementary Fig.;  Accordingly, also the MIC values of Carolacton differed notably between S. pneumoniae TIGR4 and among the clinical isolates.;  Carolacton has a potent inhibitory effect on S. pneumoniae TIGR4 and Sp49 with MIC values in the range of MICs of classical antibiotics used for the therapy of pneumococcal disease, such as e.g. ampicillin, clarithromycin or rifampicin31.;  Unspecific efflux of Carolacton over time, as a by-product of resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones, could explain why the MICs of Sp61 and Sp64 are much higher than that of S. pneumoniae TIGR4.; A Carolacton derivative with an inverted stereocentre at C-9 (epi-Carolacton) was completely inactive against both S. mutans and S. pneumoniae, as well as against several oral streptococci11.;  This indicates a highly stereospecific interaction of Carolacton with its molecular target and led us to hypothesise that the target could be highly conserved and shared between S. pneumoniae and S. mutans.;  Consequently we investigated the roles of PknB and CysR, which both had been shown to be essential for the damage of biofilm cells of S. mutans at low pH10,20, for Carolacton susceptibility in S. pneumoniae.;  Our data indicate that neither StkP nor CysR are required for susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to Carolacton and they thus cannot be its molecular target if this is conserved in both streptococci.;  StkP and CysR are apparently exclusively important for S. mutans at low pH in mature biofilms, which is a unique environment fundamentally different from planktonically growing S. pneumoniae cultures.;  Thus, Carolacton treatment leaves the plasma membrane intact in both S. mutans and S. pneumoniae during planktonic growth.; To identify components of a possible conserved response in S. mutans and S. pneumoniae, RNA-sequencing was carried out.;  Both encoded proteins have a global regulatory role in S. pneumoniae.;  As an important virulence factor, also in streptococci49, it is conceivable that by altering the transcription of gidA, Carolacton may also interfere with virulence of S. pneumoniae.;  If S. pneumoniae cells show an altered virulence after treatment with Carolacton needs to be explored further.;  This is further confirmed by comparison of the transcriptional response of S. mutans and S. pneumoniae, which suggests that these responses likely show species-specific stress reactions or compensatory mechanisms and indicate that the effect of Carolacton cannot be compensated by differential regulation of a single specific gene set.;  The proteins MreC and MreD are located at the equators and septa of dividing S. pneumoniae cells and direct peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis56.;  The extent of growth inhibition observed after Carolacton treatment in S. pneumoniae is variable, does not depend on the serotype and can even be bacteriolytic.;  S. pneumoniae TIGR4 serotype 4 (ATCC BAA-334), used for growth experiments in liquid medium, was routinely grown on Columbia blood agar plates containing 5% sheep blood (BD Biosciences) overnight (o/n) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.; Clinical S. pneumoniae isolates and information about clinical background data, serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility were obtained from Dr.;  For cryo-conservation, S. pneumoniae strains were grown in THBY to early exponential phase (OD600~0.25) and immediately frozen at −80 °C in 10% (v/v) glycerol.; S. pneumoniae was grown on Columbia blood agar plates o/n as described before.;  Ampicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline and rifampicin were included as controls during MIC determination for S. pneumoniae TIGR4, confirming target MIC values commonly reported for susceptible pneumococci31.; Transformation of S. pneumoniae was carried out by induction of competence by addition of competence stimulating peptide 2 (CSP-2) as described previously57.;  First, a defined volume (V[μl] = 300/OD600) of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 wild type and TIGR4ΔstkP cells in THBY was boiled in SDS loading dye (95 °C, 15 min) and separated via 12% (v/v) SDS PAGE according to59.; To detect changes in the membrane potential of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 when treated with Carolacton, the bacteria were stained with the fluorescent dye 3,3-Diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2(3)) (BacLight Bacterial Membrane Potential Kit, Life Technologies).; S. pneumoniae TIGR4 cells growing in THBY were washed with 0.85% (w/v) NaCl solution and mounted to a microscope slide coated with a thin layer of 1% (w/v) agarose.;  Phase-contrast microscopic analysis of S. pneumoniae was performed using an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP50 color camera (5 Mpixel) color view II camera and a 100x magnification oil immersion objective."

rickettsial,D012282,26866478,4750851," In order to study the origin, evolutionary history and putative roles of rickettsial plasmids, we investigated the evolutionary processes that have shaped 20 plasmids belonging to 11 species, using comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis between rickettsial, microbial and non-microbial genomes.;  We reconstructed pRICO, the last common ancestor of the current rickettsial plasmids. pRICO was vertically inherited mainly from Rickettsia/Orientia chromosomes and diverged vertically into a single or multiple plasmid(s) in each species.;  These plasmids also underwent a reductive evolution by progressive gene loss, similar to that observed in rickettsial chromosomes, possibly leading to cryptic plasmids or complete plasmid loss.;  Moreover, rickettsial plasmids exhibited ORFans, recent gene duplications and evidence of horizontal gene transfer events with rickettsial and non-rickettsial genomes mainly from the α/γ-proteobacteria lineages.; Deciphering rickettsial genomes revealed unexpected genetic and evolutionary features.; Rickettsial plasmids (RPs) were first detected in R. felis in which two isoforms of the putative conjugative pRf plasmid were identified [14]. Based on phylogenomic analysis, the genes in the R. felis pRf plasmid were suggested to have been acquired through a single horizontal gene transfer event in R. felis or in an ancestor before the divergence of the R. felis/ R. akari clade [14, 17]. Furthermore, on the basis of the presence of the pRf plasmid and one unpublished sequence of a putative plasmid in R. bellii OSU85-389, it was hypothesized that the primitive rickettsial ancestor harbored a plasmid system that was lost in certain lineages [23]. Moreover, Baldridge et al. [21, 22] suggested multiple possible origins of RPs as well as likely horizontal transfers from plasmids to chromosomes and vice versa using phylogenetic analyses of the parA, hsp1 and hsp2 genes.; In order to examine evolutionary relationships between Rickettsia plasmids, proteins were subjected to a reciprocical best BLAST hit (BBH) algorithm with all-against-all search (coverage of the query length > = 60% and E-value < 10-5) using COGsoft software [28, 29]. Each putative orthologous groups of plasmidic rickettsial genes was named pRIGs, and then a manual curation was performed to detect false negatives.; Evolutionary relationships between rickettsial plasmids, Rickettsia and Orientia chromosomes as well as microbial and non-microbial genomes were, first, examined using BLASTp and tBLASTn algorithms (Cutoffs: aa sequence identity > = 25%, coverage query> = 60%, E-value<10-5), search against RickettsiaDB (excluding plasmid sequences), non-redundant NR and RefSeq_genomic databases to identify their corresponding best homologs.;  The genes which did not exhibit, any significant hit neither with rickettsial chromosomes nor with other genomes from NCBI databases and having an E-value>0.01, were considered as ORFans.;  New visually inspected datasets that gathered sequences of rickettsial plasmids (each pRIG and COGID) and their corresponding homologs were downloaded and packaged into single FASTA files to perform phylogenetic analysis.;  The phylogenetic results were summarized into evolutionary networks between the rickettsial plasmids and microbial as well as non-microbial genomes using CYTOSCAPE software [34]. In the networks, the nodes represent the genes while the edges represent the links connecting them.;  Such results had previously been observed in prokaryotes [38]. We did not find any evident correlation between presence, number and/or size of plasmids, and rickettsial host range (Table 1).; The plasmidic gene content (plasmidome) counted 260 pRIGs (i.e., putative orthologous groups of plasmidic rickettsial genes) constructed from 747 protein-coding genes (Fig 2).; Overall, these data suggest that modern RPs are in a process of reductive evolution similar to that observed in rickettsial chromosomes [17]. Such a phenomenon is typical of symbiotic/parasitic lifestyles [7, 12, 13, 17, 39]. However, this finding is in contrast with the megaplasmids of the free-living Bacillus cereus group which are a fusion of smaller plasmids [40]. RPs also exhibited G+C contents ranging from 32 to 35% (Table A in S1 File).;  Such values are similar to those of the rickettsial chromosomes (Table A in S1 File), suggesting that similar evolutionary forces such as vertical and horizontal gene transfers (VGT and HGT), duplications and selection pressure, impacted both genomic components.;  In the right, summary of evolutionary events that shaped rickettsial plasmids.;  Moreover, the analysis of another four (1.4%) pRIGs (mostly present as fragments), did not result in any reliable phylogeny, but they best matched with homologs in rickettsial chromosomes (data not shown).;  The vertical inheritance is also corroborated by the presence of plasmids in two distinct rickettsial groups (SFG and AG).; In the supertree, the pRICO ancestor diverged into a single or multiple plasmid(s) in rickettsial species, and that these plasmids clustered into four putative groups (I to IV) (Fig 4): group I included 4 large and 3 small plasmids of 5 species (pRra2/pRhe/pRfe/pRfeI1/pdRfe/pRam32/pRau); group II clustered 2 large and 4 small plasmids belonging to 5 species (pReis1/pRaf/pReis2/pRam23/pRmo/pRpe); group III contained 5 small plasmids of 4 species (pRam18/pRrh/pRra1/pRma/pRmaB); and group IV gathered one large and one small plasmids from two species (pReis3/pRra3).;  This mode of evolution is described in parasitic and symbiotic organisms as a recurrent biphasic model dominated by longer phases of genome reduction and simplification, punctuated by shorter phases of episodic complexification [39]. Although the expansion via HGT and gene duplications occurred in RPs, the contraction via gene degradation and loss severely contributed to the reduction in gene content and plasmid size, and thus probably led to plasmid degradation and/or loss in several rickettsial species.;  The abundance of HGT pRIGs from rickettsial and non-rickettsial chromosomes and duplications from VGT pRIGs in the replication, recombination and repair category were mainly due to mobile transposable elements (i.e., transposases and integrases, 9 out of 13% and 5.1 out of 6%, resp.).;  These data from rickettsial plasmids corroborate a recent large-scale evolutionary study that showed that microbial plasmids share mainly genes encoding proteins involved in DNA transposition and recombination, some functions strongly linked to HGT process [25]. The single pRIG associated to translation was also exchanged with rickettsial chromosomes.;  Thus, VGT, HGT and duplication forces have driven pRIGs (e.g., dnaA-like, transposases, integrases, resolvases and relaxases) that may contribute to maintenance, rearrangements and plasticity of plasmids, making them self-replicative and simultaneously dynamic to gene exchange with various evolutionary lineages and consequent diversification of rickettsial biological activities and phenotypic traits.;  These data suggest that the role of RPs in rickettsial virulence, remains uncertain and requires further investigations.; This study offers an overview of the evolution and functional diversity of rickettsial plasmids.;  The evolutionary processes that have shaped RPs suggest that they might be influenced by molecular interactions between rickettsiae and eukaroytic host cells including biological needs for adaptation and survival, as suggested for Buchnera aphidicola in which metabolic requirements could determine when genome reduction occurs [39]. RPs may play diverse functional roles that are either novel or similar to those of rickettsial chromosomes via various evolutionary mechanisms.;  Overall, this study provides insights into rickettsial plasmids and their biology and evolution."

(1996) reported the effect of inoculation with virulent S. scabies strains on the seedlings of 14 crop plants, including monocot and dicot species.;  In addition to the predominant and well‐studied species S. scabies, other Streptomyces species are recognized as common scab‐causing agents (Beaulieu et al., 2008).;  Worthy of mention are S. turgidiscabies and S. acidiscabies, which appear to be the most widely distributed scab pathogens after S. scabies.;  The absence of the nec1 gene has been reported previously in some pathogenic S. scabies strains isolated in Finland (Kreuze et al., 1999).; Evidence for the existence of a PAI was established in S. turgidiscabies (Kers et al., 2005).;  In S. turgidiscabies, the size of the PAI has been estimated to be between 325 and 660 kb.;  However, the public release of the complete genome of S. scabies (Sanger Institute, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_scabies/) revealed a curious feature regarding the organization of PAI in this species.;  In S. scabies strain 87.22, typical genes of PAI are found in two remote regions of the bacterial chromosome.; Genes associated with toxin production are clustered in the first section of the PAI, which we will call the ‘toxicogenic region’ (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_scabies; estimated coordinates c. 3596–3653 kb; G + C content of 68%).;  A schematic representation of the organization of these genes in S. scabies has been supplied by Joshi et al. (2007b).;  The second segment of the PAI, which we will call the ‘colonization region’, contains considerably more genes (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_scabies; estimated coordinates c. 8471–8581 kb; G + C content of 68.5%).;  The presence of genes coding for esterase‐like proteins in the same region also deserves to be mentioned, as extracellular esterase activity was measured in S. scabies (Beauséjour et al., 1999; Schottel et al., 1992) and some esterases are thought to play a role in the degradation of suberin, which can act as a physical barrier against microbial invasion (Kolattukudy, 1980).; Examples of the main functions* associated with the open reading frames (ORFs) present in Streptomyces scabies pathogenicity island.; 
Streptomyces scabies possesses the capacity to produce melanoid pigments, as do several bacteria, fungi, plants and animals (Sánchez‐Ferrer et al., 1995).;  In S. scabies, the mechanisms leading to melanin production and thaxtomin synthesis are somewhat correlated.;  Beauséjour and Beaulieu (2004) generated S. scabies mutants deficient in melanin biosynthesis.;  Furthermore, all mutant strains retained the capacity to sporulate under standard conditions, but their growth and sporulation capacities showed higher sensitivity to various stresses than did the wild strain, suggesting that the synthesis of melanin and thaxtomins may be linked to the stress response in S. scabies.; 
Streptomyces scabies also has the ability to synthesize the plant growth phytohormone indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA) using tryptophan as a precursor (Manulis et al., 1994).;  In S. scabies, IAA synthesis seems to be regulated by tryptophan availability, as extracellular IAA production increases with tryptophan concentration (G.;  The role of bacterial biosynthesis of auxins in the interaction between S. scabies and potato needs to be investigated further, but auxins show remarkable effects on common scab.;  Auxins had no toxic effect on S. scabies, but 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (at a concentration of 1 mm) showed inhibitory effects on thaxtomin production (Tegg et al., 2008).; Effect of tryptophan on the relative production of thaxtomin A and indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA) in Streptomyces scabies (strain EF‐35) grown in minimal medium.;  However, the presence in the growth medium of S. scabies of the three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine, at a concentration of 2.5 mm totally inhibited or greatly reduced the production of thaxtomin A (Lauzier et al., 2002).;  Tryptophan and other aromatic amino acids therefore appear to be key molecules in the metabolism and virulence process of S. scabies.; This article is an attempt to describe concisely the most recent knowledge on the pathogenicity of S. scabies, the major pathogenic agent responsible for common scab.;  The complete sequencing and recent annotation (Loria et al., 2008) of the S. scabies genome opens up a new area."

stress,D000079225,27795310,5165121,"Pervasive environmental stressors on coral reefs are attributed with shifting the competitive balance in favor of alternative dominants, such as macroalgae.;  Macroalgae (e.g., seaweeds) can physically and chemically interact with corals, causing abrasion, bleaching, and overall stress.;  However, coral reefs are in serious decline due to a combination of interacting natural and anthropogenic stressors, such as increased sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification (2), eutrophication (3), disease (1, 4), and changes in trophic structure due to overfishing, disease, and poor management (5).;  Generally, the interactions between corals and algae are regarded as adverse to coral health, with no observed detriment to macroalgae (7), while the severity of impact may depend on both the species involved and other synergistic stressors.;  Many coral reefs are experiencing phase shifts to macroalgal dominance, and Lobophora sp. in particular has taken advantage of environmental stressors at some localized sites.;  When corals are under stress, the relative abundance of Endozoicomonas spp. has been shown to decline significantly.;  These studies provide additional evidence that stress may cause a shift in and/or loss of key members of the coral microbiome that can coincide with a shift to a community dominated by opportunistic and fast-growing bacteria.;  Coupled with temperature stress, increasing algal cover facilitated blooms of putative opportunists or pathogens related to the order Alteromonadales, members of the phylum Proteobacteria (e.g., Vibrionales and Oscillatoriales), and other rare microbial orders, and it suppressed native microbial associates, such as Synechococcus (58).;  It has been suggested that environmental stress, such as algal overgrowth, can facilitate a shift from a healthy coral microbiome, dominated by antibiotic-producing beneficial microbes, to an alternate pathogen-dominated state (60).;  Here, coral tissues directly exposed to Lobophora sp. extracts demonstrated a microbiome shift to Vibrio sp. dominance (55%), rising from a background level of 3%. In a similar manner, Zaneveld et al. (58) demonstrated that members related to the order Vibrionales represented 62% of the microbiome in corals under stress, rising from a previous level of 5%, both indicative of a shift to an alternate stable state.;  In fact, thermal stress resulted in the coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus suppressing both coral innate immune pathways (62) and the antibiotic properties of coral mucus (63).;  Thus, allelochemical stress caused by encroaching macroalgae may elicit a community-wide destabilization of the microbiome, shift to pathogen dominance, and ultimately coral disease and/or mortality.;  Macroalgae have species-specific impacts on coral hosts and their associated bacteria, sometimes having the potential to alter pathways related to bacterial stress responses, pathogenesis, and symbiosis, as well as carbohydrate metabolism (23).;  Future work would also benefit from examining both the aqueous- and organic-derived compounds, which will likely lead to new discoveries in natural product research and advance our understanding of macroalgal competition on coral reefs, particularly as coral reefs are subjected to increasing human-derived environmental stressors."

stress,D000079225,25539760,4367926," Among the factors whose expression was enhanced during the initial part of germination, SigE is though to manage cell wall reconstruction, SigR controls protein re-aggregation, and others (SigH, SigB, SigI, SigJ) control osmotic and oxidative stress responses.;  From the analysis of sigma factors we conclude that conditions favoring germination evoke stress-like cell responses.; Other stresses such as disulfide stress also leads to protein aggregation.;  Since RsrA releases SigR under thiol-oxidative stress conditions [35], we may speculate that the initial phase of germination, being a transition from a dormant to a metabolically active state under aerobic conditions, generates oxidative stress.;  SigH was suggested to control both the septation of aerial hyphae and, as SigR, the osmotic stress response [33–40]. The osmotic stress response is possibly achieved in cooperation with the anti-anti-sigma factor BldG [41]. The bldG mRNA was highly abundant in dormant spores and as well as SigH, its level decreased in t1-t2 interval (4×) and remained constant until the end.;  On contrary, the re-activation of SigH expression in t2-t3 suggests that its regulon is not only expressed during sporulation but also in germination, when massive water entry likely generates osmotic stress.;  In addition to responses to both osmotic and oxidative stresses, the SigB regulon also contains other sigma factors, oxidative defense proteins, and chaperones that play a role in cell differentiation [43]. Since the expression of only a few sigma factors was down regulated during the period preceding t7-t8, the steady state level of expression of the others (including that of SigB and SigI) might control the metabolic processes occurring at t7-t8.;  Streptomycetes ECF sigma factors are known to respond to various stresses to which soil dwelling bacteria are naturally exposed.;  Also other similarities could be found between germination and stress conditions.;  The conditions that prompt a spore to germinate involve heat shock (used in our experiments to induce synchronous germination), osmotic as well as oxidative/disulfide stresses.;  Activation of SigR, SigH and LitS signals oxidative stress as that of SigB, SigH, SigI, SigJ signals osmotic stress.;  Based on the induction of other sigma factors, most of which are known to respond to various stresses, we suggest that germination evokes stress-like responses as a consequence of the disruption of the internal steady conditions of the spore, which leads to an influx of water, oxygen (and its radicals), salts, and even light, as reflected in LitS expression."

stress,D000079225,26048933,4551249," Shared responses of these organisms to (near-)zero growth rates include increased stress tolerance and a downregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis.; The severe energy limitation in retentostats potentially is a stress factor for the culture.;  Indeed, a third conserved transcriptional response observed in the five microorganisms mentioned above encompassed an increased expression of genes involved in stress responses.;  L. lactis and S. cerevisiae showed increased expression of genes involved in general stress resistance, including heat shock proteins (GroELS and DnaKJ protein complexes in L. lactis and Hsp12, Hsp26, Hsp30, Hsp78, and Ssa3 in S. cerevisiae) (Fig. 5).;  These responses were shown to confer increased tolerance of heat stress on yeast and of heat, acid, and oxidative stress conditions on L. lactis (4, 61; O.;  General stress response regulons were not significantly induced in retentostat cultures of B. subtilis and L. plantarum (6, 40).;  A. niger showed increased expression of genes involved in the synthesis of stress-protectant compounds during retentostat cultures (7), while the induction of sporulation in this fungus can also be interpreted as an adaptation to the stress imposed by (near-)zero growth (62, 63).;  Some cellular responses observed in retentostats, such as reduced expression of B. subtilis genes involved in motility and strongly increased stress resistance of S. cerevisiae and L. lactis, resembled characteristics of stationary-phase, energy-starved cultures.; In addition to the potential of retentostats to enable near-theoretical product yields, the strongly increased stress resistance of retentostat-grown L. lactis and S. cerevisiae provides leads for the design of fermentation protocols that improve survival under subsequent industrial processing and storage conditions.;  For example, eliciting increased heat and/or oxidative stress tolerance by introducing a (near-)zero growth phase may be explored as a strategy to produce robust starter cultures."
stress,D000079225,23319638,3562829," A comparison of the transcriptomes from in planta cells and from cells exposed to osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and iron and nitrogen limitation indicated that water availability, in particular, was limited in both leaf habitats but was more severely limited in the apoplast than on the leaf surface under the conditions tested.;  In contrast, bacteria in the apoplast likely experience slight acidity and oxidative stress resulting from the plant’s defenses.;  The treatments included exposing cells to a basal medium, sodium chloride to confer an osmotic stress, hydrogen peroxide to confer an oxidative stress, iron limitation, nitrogen limitation, and epiphytic and apoplastic growth (Methods and Figs.;  Among the remaining treatments, osmotic stress had the largest effect, whereas oxidative stress and iron limitation had relatively small effects.;  These results may reflect a broader array of genes required for cellular adaptation to osmotic stress than to oxidative stress and low iron and/or stress attenuation caused by peroxide detoxification.;  Colors indicate treatments, which include nitrogen limitation (Low N); epiphytic sites (Epiphytic); apoplastic sites (Apoplastic); osmotic stress (NaCl); basal medium (Basal); oxidative stress (H2O2); and iron limitation (Low Fe).; We evaluated the extent to which the transcriptomes in planta reflected exposure to each environmental stress by correlation analysis of the combined dataset, i.e., the pooled data from the three laboratories.;  When transcript levels relative to the basal medium were plotted for the in vitro and in planta treatments, the transcripts that were increased in the epiphytic and apoplastic sites correlated most strongly with those increased in the osmotic stress and nitrogen-limitation treatments (Fig. 2).;  These plots also show the general direction and magnitude of the changes in transcript abundance, with the nitrogen-limitation treatment causing large decreases as well as increases in transcript abundance and the other stresses primarily causing only increases.;  This result is consistent with nitrogen limitation inducing a metabolic downshift and the other stresses inducing specific adaptations.; Correlation between the P. syringae transcriptomes of cells exposed to environmental stresses in vitro and those recovered from (A) epiphytic sites or (B) apoplastic sites.;  The log(fold-change) values of the transcript levels of all the genes in the in vitro stress treatments relative to transcript levels in the basal medium (y axes) were plotted against those of the in planta treatments relative to transcript levels in the basal medium (x axes).; We also evaluated the extent to which the transcriptomes in planta reflected exposure to each stress by using multiple regression analysis.;  For the transcriptomes identified in each laboratory and the combined dataset, we regressed the transcript levels of all the genes in the epiphytic transcriptome on those of the in vitro stresses and basal medium while constraining the coefficients to be nonnegative and to sum to one (Table 1); we did the same for the apoplastic transcriptome data.;  The resulting coefficients suggested a large contribution of osmotic stress and nitrogen limitation to the transcriptome of cells in epiphytic and apoplastic sites.;  Moreover, within each dataset, the osmotic stress transcriptome was correlated more strongly to the apoplastic transcriptome than to the epiphytic transcriptome, suggesting that P. syringae experienced a more severe water limitation in the leaf interior than on the leaf surface.;  Surprisingly, the in planta transcriptomes were correlated most poorly with the oxidative stress transcriptome, possibly because of the relatively small impact of oxidative stress on the transcriptome of P. syringae, an unexpected attenuation of the applied stress, or a response of the cells to oxidative stress in planta that was distinct from the response seen in vitro.; Correlation coefficients from a multiple regression analysis of the transcriptome in epiphytic or apoplastic sites on the transcriptomes of cells exposed to the basal medium and to each of the four environmental stresses in vitro;  The categories with overrepresented genes that were induced in cells exposed to osmotic stress and iron and nitrogen limitation generally reflected the functions known to be bacterial responses to these stresses (Fig. 4C).;  It also contributes to B728a fitness on bean leaf surfaces, in part by promoting movement to sites protected from environmental stresses (11).;  Several GABA genes, including gabT and gabD, were induced by osmotic stress; this observation is consistent with the speculation that GabT has a role in polyamine homeostasis and thus in osmoregulation (22).; Three of the functional categories that were overrepresented based on gene induction in planta also were induced by osmotic stress (Fig. 4 A and C).;  Transcripts of genes involved in the synthesis and regulation of alginate, a polysaccharide associated with enhanced tolerance to water limitation (30), were increased an average of twofold by the in planta treatments (Fig. 5) and 3.8-fold by osmotic stress (Table S3).;  Biosynthetic genes for the two major compatible solutes of B728a, N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide (NAGGN) and trehalose (31), showed an even more pronounced induction in planta than the alginate genes, with an average of 13.2- and 8.2-fold induction in the apoplast for the NAGGN and trehalose genes, respectively (Fig. 5), as well as a strong response to osmotic stress, with an average of 42.5- and 10.9-fold induction, respectively (Table S3).; Genes for antioxidant enzymes were overrepresented in the transcriptome of cells exposed to oxidative stress but were not overrepresented in the in planta transcriptomes (Table S1).;  Of 17 antioxidant enzymes, genes for five were induced by oxidative stress: ahpF, ahpC, ohr, katA, and sodA.;  These results suggest that B728a was exposed to some oxidative stress in plants and to more oxidative stress in the apoplast than on the leaf surface, as is consistent with a role for oxidative stress in plant defense, but also suggest that the protective enzymes invoked by B728a against oxidative stress in a host plant are distinct from those invoked in culture.;  The conserved regulation of this transporter, namely induction by an osmotic upshift and by severe potassium starvation, suggests more osmotic fluctuations in epiphytic than apoplastic sites (because kdpFABC expression decreases once cells reach homeostasis in the presence of osmotic stress) or a deficit of potassium in surface sites, although the driving force for such a deficit is not clear.;  Third, the betIAB genes that enable conversion of choline to the osmoprotective compound glycine betaine were induced more in the apoplast (8.1-fold) than in epiphytic sites (3.3-fold), supporting previous evidence that choline is abundant on leaves (38) and that water stress may be greater in the apoplast.; Transcript profiles in the apoplast support a model in which B728a cells experience at least low levels of oxidative stress, with potentially distinct responses to this stress in planta and in culture.;  Moreover, the cells experience surprisingly high levels of water stress, which could be related to plant defense, as shown for a resistance response (41) or could be an effect of rapid evapotranspiration or high solute concentrations in interior sites.;  The cells were washed in HMM-FeN and resuspended in HMM-FeN to a final density of 2.5 × 109 cfu/mL Aliquots were transferred to five test tubes and diluted to 2.5 × 108 cfu/mL with (i) HMM medium; (ii) HMM medium with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.23 M;

stresses,D000079225,15141066,429332," In this communication, we describe a novel approach to exploring these rhizosphere VOCs and their induction by biotic stresses.;  It is noteworthy that the sampling and analysis of plant VOCs by gas chromatography (GC) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods can be very time-consuming and until recently it has generally not been feasible to follow the kinetics of formation of VOCs following most kinds of biotic stresses.;  It is well known that some metabolic VOCs, such as acetaldehyde and ethanol, are formed in flooded roots (Drew, 1997), but the measurement of volatiles formed in roots subjected to biotic stresses has received very little attention.;  Second, we hypothesize that the quantitative and qualitative emission of VOCs by roots, as measured by PTR-MS, may be significantly different than those released from the aerial parts of the plant, thus providing VOC signatures of biotic stresses to roots.;  Because PTR-MS allows simultaneous real time analysis of most biogenic VOCs, we were able to follow the kinetics of induction of root-derived VOCs and related systemic VOCs after elicitation with biotic stresses.;  Such a capability, coupled with the tools available in the Arabidopsis system such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and knock-out and transposon-tagged mutatagenesis (Trethewey et al., 2001), may facilitate our understanding of the biological implications of VOC emission by plant roots in response to biotic stresses and help identify essential genes in these processes."

toxicity,D064420,21360140,3098371," In soil, predation by bacterivorous nematodes is a major selective pressure shaping soil bacterial communities, and many bacteria have evolved defence mechanisms such as toxicity.;  All studied secondary metabolites contributed to the toxicity of the bacteria, with hydrogen cyanide efficiently repelling the nematodes, and both hydrogen cyanide and 2,4-DAPG functioning as nematicides.;  Many strains produce secondary metabolites, such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), phenazines and hydrogen cyanide, thereby inhibiting soil-borne pathogens [1]. The success of these bacteria depends on various factors, such as their ability to efficiently exploit root exudates [2], but also to withstand predation by nematodes and protozoa [3, 4]. Predation is a major cause of bacterial mortality and profoundly impacts the structure and function of root-associated bacterial communities [5, 6]. Bacteria have evolved an array of antipredatory resistance mechanisms, such as toxicity, and in soil, unpalatable or toxic strains gain competitive advantage in presence of predators [3, 7]. Therefore, the production of secondary metabolites by biocontrol bacteria serves multiple functions, and metabolites protecting plants against pathogens improve for example bacterial resistance against predators [8, 9].;  Knocking out single metabolite genes was not sufficient to eliminate the nematicide activity, suggesting that all tested exoproducts contributed to bacterial toxicity and/or that some of them do not kill nematodes.

;  However, no single knockout was sufficient to entirely suppress bacterial toxicity suggesting that various secondary metabolites are involved in the interaction with nematodes.; Knockout mutants deficient in the production of one of the secondary metabolites showed an altered toxicity against the nematodes in the slow killing assay.;  With the exception of the GacS− strain (lacking all exoproducts), the strain deficient in HCN production showed the lowest toxicity.;  By inhibiting mitochondrial activity [24], DAPG plays an important role in the inhibition of competing bacteria [10] and predators [9, 25], but also in the control of plant-parasitic nematodes by pseudomonads [13, 26]. Extracellular proteases are another class of compounds functioning as nematicide, and in agreement with previous studies on root knot nematodes [27], deactivation of the production of the alkaline protease AprA resulted in reduced toxicity of bacteria against C. elegans.;  Surprisingly, the PLT-deficient mutant of P. fluorescens was more toxic for C. elegans than the wild type, while the DAPG-deficient mutant presented reduced toxicity.;  Production of DAPG and PLT is balanced, each compound inhibiting the synthesis of the other, and PLT-deficient mutants overproduce DAPG [28]. Consequently, the higher toxicity of the PLT-deficient mutant probably was an indirect effect of DAPG overproduction, underlining the toxicity of DAPG."
toxicity,D064420,24141121,3911035," The application of either organisms or compounds requires that they do not cause any side effects, such as toxicity in eukaryotic organisms.;  The toxicity of P. luteoviolacea S4060 could be related to the production of the antibacterial compound pentabromopseudilin, while the adverse effect observed in the presence of P. halotolerans S2753 and V. coralliilyticus S2052 could not be explained by the production of holomycin nor andrimid, the respective antibiotic compounds in these organisms.;  Hence, the toxicity of live bacterial cultures and bioactive compounds on the target organisms should be tested and any adverse effect ruled out before they can be applied.;  C. elegans has been developed as a model to assess virulence of many human, animal, and plant microbial pathogens (14) and the toxicity of different compounds (11).;  Furthermore, Artemia spp. are used as live feed for cultured fish and shellfish in aquaculture, and this gives it additional value as a toxicity model in aquaculture systems, e.g., for testing probiotic cultures.;  The toxicity of all live bacterial cultures was analyzed by using both Artemia sp. and C. elegans as eukaryotic models but, since the majority of the compounds were not commercially available and could be extracted only in small amounts, the toxicity of the pure compounds was only tested on Artemia sp.;  In the toxicity assay using C. elegans, bacterial strains were grown on Väätänen nine salts solution (VNSS) (25).;  In the present study, Artemia sp. and C. elegans were used as eukaryotic models to provide a first assessment of potential toxicity of bacterial bioactive compounds and the producing bacteria themselves.;  The potential mode of action of arthrobacilin is not known and, hence, the specific mechanism of toxicity is difficult to explain.;  These results already indicated that violacein was not the compound responsible of the toxicity observed, and this was confirmed by testing the pure compounds.;  In contrast, the lack of toxicity of the live cultures of the TDA-producing Roseobacter species reaffirms their suitability as probiotics in aquaculture."
toxicity,D064420,21326924,3026423," However, their use at the dose required for therapeutic efficacy has always been associated with toxicity problems and other deleterious effects.; Clostridia are a group of anaerobes and, therefore, constitute an ideal tool to target solid tumors since in most cases these tumors show increased levels of hypoxia.7 In 1947, it was shown that the injection of spores of Clostridium histolyticus caused oncolysis, then referred to as “liquefaction,” of a transplanted mouse sarcoma.8Clostridium tetani spores were also used and tumor-bearing mice died 48 hours after the treatment in contrast to the healthy controls.9 This experience proved that a specific microenvironment is required to bacterial survival and development but also that toxicity remained a problem with live bacteria.;  As example, the simultaneous use of the C. novyi-NT spores with a DNA-damaging drug and an anti-vascular agent, mitomycin C and dolastin-10, respectively, resulted in very satisfactory tumor shrinking, however it was always accompanied by severe toxicity.23; Other drugs were or are being tested in combination with these spores: taxanes like docetaxel and MAC-321 which are microtubules stabilizers and have demonstrated decreased toxicity, although with slow tumor regression.;  After showing the lower toxicity in several animal models, Pawelek and colleagues injected it into tumor-bearing mice and showed its specificity to tumors.35 Additionally, Salmonella strains were engineered to produce several proteins and toxins with anticancer activity: CD, TNFα, mitomycin C, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and colicin E3.;  The main toxicity problems associated with the treatment were flu-like symptoms, resembling those observed with interleukin-2, probably related to a strong immune response triggered by the bacteria.;  The inhibitory action of SSL5, without any observed toxicity, was demonstrated in HL-60 leukemia cells since these cells express the receptor P-selectin glycoprotein-1 (PSGL-1).;  To reduce immunogenicity, ADI was covalently bound to PEG 20,000 and renamed as ADI-PEG20 (Polaris, Inc.), maintaining approximately 50% of its specific activity and increasing half-life in the animal models.77 It was shown that ADI-PEG20 inhibited in vivo and in vitro growth of human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, which were found as auxotrophic for arginine due to a deficiency in ASS.78,79 Phase I and II clinical trials have been performed in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma.80–86 The results of the hepatocellular carcinoma showed only a moderate antitumor activity with tolerable toxicity, and in some cases, some patients couldn't complete the therapy as a result of allergic diseases.;  These chimeric proteins contain the Exotoxin A (a toxic domain for cytotoxicity) fused either to monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments or physiologically important ligands like cytokines and growth factors.;  Protein engineering has recently been developed to increase affinity towards cancer cells, increasing specificity, cytotoxicity and maximum tolerated doses in the treated mice and also PEGylated forms of immunotoxins were tested.95 Previous studies showed cytotoxicities were similar to the native form, but half-lives were prolonged and animal toxicity was considerably reduced.96;  The modifications in the derivatives are made in order to improve specific properties that hamper the biological activity like water and plasma solubility, toxicity and binding ability to the microtubules.114 Unlike paclitaxel, ZK-EPO, one of epitholone B derivatives, is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, is a potential agent for penetration into the central nervous system.;  Since J774 is a tumor cell line, it was of interest to see if azurin would demonstrate similar cytotoxicity towards human cancer cells.;  Using HL60, an acute myeloid cell line, and K562, a chronic myeloid cell line, Kwan et al. demonstrated the high cytotoxicity of Laz towards both HL60 and K562 cells at modest concentrations (10 µM induced a loss in cell viability of about 90%).126"

toxicity,D064420,25325384,4349496,"Toxic freshwater cyanobacteria form harmful algal blooms that can cause acute toxicity to humans and livestock.; For decades, harmful algal blooms, formed by freshwater cyanobacteria, have been linked to acute toxicity to humans and livestock (Hudnell, 2008).;  Surprisingly, lineage 1 also contained a number of strains that retained the mcy gene cluster, suggesting that the loss of toxicity per se did not lead to phylogenetic diversification.; The acute toxicity of MC to various aquatic biota contributes to the deterrence of grazers (Kurmayer and Jüttner, 1999) and parasites (Rohrlack et al., 2013), although various physiological functions of MC have been suggested (Neilan et al., 2013).;  Oscillapeptin J, a member of the family of the cyanopeptolins, has been described as an effective inhibitor of chymotrypsin and trypsin and showed comparable toxicity against herbivores compared with the major MC structural variant purified from the same strain of P. rubescens (Blom et al., 2006).; It is tempting to assume that the loss of toxicity of MC might be replaced by other bioactive peptides, such as oscillapeptin or planktocyclin, that have been shown to deter potential grazers (see above).;  Other MC-deficient strains (Nos. 405, 406, 496/1, 550, 551) also contained chlorinated/sulfated aeruginosins of unknown toxicity."
toxicity,D064420,19806188,2751819," The presence of DA exacerbated toxicity because neurodegeneration was attenuated in mutant nematodes depleted for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA production.;  These data were extended to human DA-producing neurons, where the bacterial metabolite also exhibited dose-dependent toxicity.; When considering potential environmental sources of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative disorders, we were intrigued by reports that described DA neurodegeneration and PD-like symptoms following direct injection of proteasome inhibitors into rat brains [10], [11]. This prompted us to initially determine if exposure to proteasome inhibitors could cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans.;  Support for a “multiple hit” hypothesis for induction of neurodegeneration in PD has recently come from an elegant study indicating that increased cytosolic DA levels influence neurotoxicity through generation of oxidized metabolites that interact with α-synuclein, an effect that is blocked by calcium channel blockers [36]. We previously showed that overexpression of the C. elegans TH homolog, CAT-2, in nematode DA neurons also led to increased neurodegeneration, an effect that was blocked by 3-iodotyrosine treatment (13).;  Given the substantial neuroprotective impact of TH mutants on the toxicity caused by the Streptomyces metabolite in C. elegans, it is interesting to speculate this environmental factor may represent an added multifactoral component in DA neurodegeneration.;  Nevertheless, in the context of our findings with more common non-pathogenic bacterial species, a prospective role for bacterial metabolites as environmental effectors of neurotoxicity is understudied and should perhaps be revisited.;  In this regard, surveys of strain-specific effects, chronic vs. acute exposure paradigms, and community-based epidemiological analyses are all required to better define the impact of bacterial sources of neurotoxicity."

They comprise a group of over 100 compounds isolated from natural sources and several thousand derivatives that have been synthesized by chemical methods [4,5]. In addition to being able to intercalate DNA and inhibit topoisomerases, phenazines act through their redox activity, which enables them to exchange electrons with e.g."
toxicity,D064420,25514094,4280539," In summary, microcystins can undergo abiotic and biotic processes that alter the toxicity and structure of the microcystin molecule.;  The environmental impact and toxicity of these alterations and the metabolism of microcystins remains uncertain, making it difficult to establish guidelines for human health.; The toxicity of microcystins varies according to the combination of amino acids at the two variable positions on the peptide ring (Figure 1) [12,21]. The oral LD50 for MC-LR in rats and mice is 5 mg/kg of body weight [22,23]. For comparison, the oral LD50 for cyanide is 3 mg/kg of body weight [24]. The oral LD50 for microcystin-RR (MC-RR), a microcystin congener with two arginine groups attached to the peptide ring, is ten-fold higher than that of MC-LR [23]. The LD50 for MC-RR and MC-LR administered intraperitoneally in mice are 235.4 and 43 µg/kg body weight, respectively [15]. MC-RR is more polar than MC-LR and is not as easily transported via the bile acid transport system as MC-LR, hence the observed difference in toxicity [12]. Microcystin-LA (MC-LA), which has leucine and alanine at the two variable positions on the peptide ring, has an intraperitoneal LD50 identical to that of MC-LR [25,26,27,28]. Different microcystin congeners vary in their response to the protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA).; Dilution is a major process by which microcystin toxicity is reduced in natural waters [36,37]. Microcystins are released into the surrounding environment after a bloom senesces or cells are ruptured.; These biological detoxification pathways are important in determining the toxicity of microcystins in an ecosystem.; The World Health Organization (WHO) has instituted a daily tolerable intake for lifetime human exposure of MC-LR of 0.04 µg/kg of body weight/day limit from food, based on studies in rats [22,23,27]. This has been expanded upon to create seasonal daily exposure tolerable intake of MC-LR in food of 300 µg/kg of food for adults and 40 µg/kg of food for children [34]. An acceptable daily limit of 39 µg/kg of fish for adults (aged 17 and above) and 24 µg/kg of fish for children (aged 2–16) was derived based on the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 40 µg/kg/day [35]. However, these regulations are based on the toxicity of the parent toxin, not the metabolic products.;  In environments where this selectivity is not possible, such as water bodies with very large toxic blooms, organisms can adapt by developing a tolerance to microcystin toxicity [118,130,131].; The degree to which an organism is resistant to microcystin toxicity is variable between species.; There is a difference in the physiological response to microcystin toxicity between terrestrial and aquatic organisms.; Bivalves may also resist microcystin toxicity through expulsion of Microcystis in the form of pseudofeces [135,136]. Dreissena polymorpha is indiscriminate in the uptake of cyanobacterial strains as a food resource, regardless of toxicity [134]. However, D. polymorpha will produce pseudofeces in the presence of toxic cyanobacteria [98]. In the laboratory, D. polymorpha was exposed to both toxic Microcystis aeruginosa and the non-toxic diatom, Asterionella formosa [135]. Pseudofeces produced by these zebra mussels contained mostly Microcystis, not the non-toxic diatom.;  Bivalves in general may have a greater resistance to toxicity than other organisms [137]. An increase in the multidrug resistance protein activity was immediately observed when Dreissena polymorpha was exposed to MC-LR, as well as other xenobiotics [137]. Bivalves may be better equipped than other aquatic organisms for resisting toxicity [137].; Zooplankton are an important part of the food web in natural systems and exhibit species-dependent degrees of resistance to microcystin toxicity.; Cladocerans, such as Daphnia, are relatively non-selective feeders and cannot exclude toxic cyanobacterial strains from the diet [3]. Daphnia of different species do not have equivalent responses to microcystin exposure [138,160,165]. Of four Daphnia species examined, Daphnia magna was the least resistant to toxicity and experienced feeding inhibition in the presence of toxic Microcystis after 1 h of exposure [165]. D. galeata did not show any sign of feeding inhibition over a 1-h period under the same feeding conditions as D. magna, and the feeding rate of D. pulex was more inhibited than that of D. pulicaria [160,165]. Other species demonstrated varying degrees of growth inhibition.;  Younger Daphnia may be better adapted to survival in an environment with microcystins, as increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in response to microcystin toxicity decreased with age [131,166]. The extent of damage to organisms by microcystins varies between Daphnia clones, as well as by age, and it can be difficult to assess the organismal effect of microcystin exposure.;  Other microcystin congeners and their metabolic products possess varying degrees of toxicity by PPIA [29] and by the mouse bioassay [85]. The variants of microcystins present and detected for monitoring will impact the toxicity of tissues and are an important component in monitoring.; Information on the rate of microcystin metabolism in various organisms is limited, yet is essential for accurate toxicity assessments regarding microcystin exposure due to alterations in the environment, as well as via food web transfer.; The rate of microcystin metabolism differs between species, as does the degree of resistance to microcystin toxicity.;  More studies on this reversible conjugation are essential for a more complete understanding of the toxicity, transport and transformation of microcystins in living cells.;  Abiotic and microbial breakdown of microcystins, as well as the potential toxicity of the conjugated MC-LR metabolites produced by organisms in their tissues also makes the determination of human health guidelines difficult.; Additional information on the rate of formation of these conjugates, as well as the rate of degradation of microcystins by microbes is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the role metabolism plays in the toxicity of MC-LR in natural systems.; The number of microcystins and bioactive metabolites produced by cyanobacteria and impacted species is continually increasing as new and more advanced chemical techniques are applied to the identification of these compounds [188]. Microcystin congeners other than MC-LR, as well as any possible metabolites are integral to making accurate toxicity assessments and should be incorporated into the implementation of human health guidelines.;  However, care must be taken to ensure that the response in these in vitro assays is representative of the in vivo toxicity, as properties, such as uptake and transport, are rarely captured by these in vitro tests.;  A better understanding of the occurrence of different congeners, their metabolic products and the toxicity of the between different microcystin congeners would help in this regard.

toxicity,D064420,28067831,5295230," These cytotoxicity observations suggest that toxicity may be related to the polyol character of these polyketide compounds.; Trichodesmium thiebautii, a marine filamentous cyanobacterium of the order Oscillatoriales, is globally significant both for its biogeochemical role in N2 fixation [14] and the biological community associated with the “floating islands” formed by dense blooms that can cover many kilometers of surface waters [15]. Trichodesmium blooms occur over most of the subtropical and tropical oceans with the greatest concentration in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Sea [16]. Repeated blooms occur in the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico from February through August [17]. These blooms have been hypothesized to contribute the nitrogen required for the initiation of Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico [18]. Studies carried out using homogenized cells, filtrates, aging cultures, and crude extracts of Trichodesmium thiebautii filaments have shown toxicity to copepods [19,20]. However, establishing uni-algal, actively growing cultures of T. thiebautii has been problematic and has limited the ability to characterize these toxic molecules [21]. Thus, members of the cyanobacterial genus Trichodesmium remain an under-sampled group with few metabolites described from the genus.;  This specimen showed a phylogenetic relationship to other Trichodesmium strains and may be a new species [23]. A chlorinated metabolite, trichotoxin, displaying some cytotoxicity was isolated from a field sample of Trichodesmium thiebautii [24]. Recently, our laboratory has revised the structure of trichotoxin, renaming it trichotoxin A, and have isolated and characterized an alkyne-containing analog trichotoxin B [25].;  Trichophycin A (1) showed moderate cytotoxicity against Neuro-2A murine neuroblastoma cells and HCT-116 human colon cancer cells with EC50 values of 6.5 ± 1.4 μM and 11.7 ± 0.6 μM, respectively.; Trichophycin A (1) showed moderate cytotoxicity against selected cells lines with EC50 values against Neuro-2A cells and HCT-116 cells of 6.5 ± 1.4 μM and 11.7 ± 0.6 μM, respectively (Figure 3).;  This increased polyol character may be a reason for the increased cytotoxicity of 1 (EC50 = 6.5 μM) compared to that originally reported for trichotoxin A (LC50 = 106 μM) against Neuro-2A cells [24] and this study (EC50 > 50 μM against Neuro-2A cells).;  Ketoreductases generally control the configuration of β-hydroxy and secondary methyl groups in polyketide biosynthesis [28,29,30]. Work will continue to explore potential biological activities of 1 and search for structurally related analogs from Trichodesmium blooms in order to continue to evaluate the relationship between polyol character and cytotoxicity.;  The fractions eluting with 60% EtOAc in hexanes and 80% EtOAc in hexanes (Fractions E and F) were combined based on similarities in 1H-NMR signals and similar potency in cytotoxicity assays.;  The fraction eluting with CH3CN showed the most potent cytotoxicity and was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a YMC 5 μm ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm) with an elution solvent of 80% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% formic acid added and trichophycin (1) (15 mg, rt: 9.25 min) was isolated.;  Figure S8: Cytotoxicity data of trichotoxin A and B against HCT-116 cells."

This feature is particularly important in the search for new therapeutic alternatives because of the emergence of resistant strains and toxicity caused by these drugs [77]. In the literature, there are studies that demonstrate the resulting synergism of the associations between β-lactams and aminoglycosides [78,79] and between aminoglycosides and natural products [80–82]."

The focus of this paper was hence to report whether the bioactive compounds derived from the leaves of in vitro plantlets of A. annua possess antimicrobial activity towards an array of bacteria and fungus of Malaysian local isolates and also the toxicity level of these compounds on brine shrimp.;  These toxicity assays [11] are used to assess the toxicity level of the bioactive compounds derived from the in vitro plantlets of A. annua.;  These two compounds obtained from each A. annua clone were used for the subsequent antimicrobial screening and toxicity tests.;  Purple band denotes precursor and pink band denotes artemisinin compounds which were purified separately by column chromatography and used for the antimicrobial screening and toxicity test.;  Within one hour of incubation, the brine shrimps were all dead indicating high toxicity level of artemisinin and precursor against brine shrimp growth, and thus LC50 could not be determined.;  While artemisinin of 9 mg/mL derived from the field grown plants was needed to inhibit malaria causing Plasmodium falciparum [32]. The result obtained from our study on the brine shrimp toxicity test suggested that artemisinin and precursor could be very toxic when used at high concentration because as low as 0.09 mg/mL of both the artemisinin and its precursor caused high mortality rate (100%) of the brine shrimp."
toxicity,D064420,22039419,3198455," Through this study we have demonstrated that combinatorial synthesis of non-natural flavonones can identify novel antimicrobial agents with activity against bacteria and fungi but with minimal toxicity to human cells.;  Specifically, chalcones hybrids have been shown to be potent against a range of organisms including Staphylococcus aureus
[12], [13]. Numerous other studies have identified antimicrobial activities of other flavonoid classes as well [11], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Despite these efforts, flavonoids and flavonoid-like molecules have failed to become treatment options due to several factors including combinatorial-potency, molecule toxicity and the fact that sufficiently large polyphenol libraries are hampered by a low abundance in plant material or difficult purification strategies.;  HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC as a model human cell line for toxicity testing.; In an effort to improve the bacterial toxicity of flavanones, a small library of non-natural flavanones was created by chemical synthesis, although large-scale synthesis can be accomplished through microbial fermentations in a mutasynthses approach [20]. Synthesis of the non-natural flavanones was completed in four reaction steps, which form protected chalcone intermediates and then follow with de-protection and ring closure.; One of the challenges of antifungal therapies is that the close phylogenetic reslationship between fungi and mammals often results in cross-kingdom toxicity.;  To address the question of cytotoxicity, cell viability assays of the chemically synthesized drugs were performed with the natural flavanone naringenin used as a benchmark for cell toxicity.;  Importantly, while the non-natural compounds were shown to be potent anti-microbial agents, the cyotitoxicity was relatively low.;  Finally, by verifying that these non-natural flavanones displayed little to no toxicity to mammalian cells, it shows a greater potential to used them as drug candidates for further functional development and clinical testing."

 Both rpoB mutants showed significant upregulation of the polyketide synthase genes ppsA-ppsE and drrA, which constitute an operon encoding multifunctional enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate and other lipids in M. tuberculosis, but also of various secondary metabolites in related organisms, including antibiotics, such as erythromycin and rifamycins. ppsA (Rv2931), ppsB (Rv2932), and ppsC (Rv2933) were also found to be upregulated more than 10-fold in the Beijing rpoB mutant strain relative to its wild-type parent strain during infection of activated murine macrophages.;  These data suggest that rpoB mutation in M. tuberculosis may trigger compensatory transcriptional changes in secondary metabolism genes analogous to those observed in related actinobacteria.;  These findings may assist in developing novel methods to diagnose and treat drug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections.; Approximately 9 million people develop active tuberculosis (TB) each year, resulting in nearly 2 million deaths annually (75).;  Recent progress controlling drug-susceptible TB has been made in many regions (50); however, drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including strains resistant to both first-line drugs, isoniazid and rifampin (multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB), has emerged as a threat to TB control worldwide (26, 65).; Drug resistance in M. tuberculosis is due primarily to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding key mycobacterial enzymes (6).;  Although some rifampin-resistant strains demonstrate mild in vitro fitness losses compared to wild-type (WT) parental strains, the most common M. tuberculosis clinical strains containing the most frequent rpoB mutations (e.g., the S531L mutation) tend to exhibit little or no fitness defects, suggesting that certain M. tuberculosis isolates are capable of overcoming, at least to some extent, initial fitness deficiencies associated with antibiotic resistance (24, 25).;  Bergval et al. reported a 2- to 5-fold induction of the stress response gene dnaE2 (but not recA) in four of six rpoB mutants of M. tuberculosis compared to their wild-type isogenic parent strains using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (5).;  However, relatively little is known about M. tuberculosis adaptive mechanisms, which may compensate for mutations in rpoB.;  Recently, compensatory mutations in RNA polymerase genes in rpoB mutant isolates of M. tuberculosis have been identified by comparative genomics (18).; Specific gene upregulation associated with rpoB mutation has been observed in numerous model organisms, including Streptomyces spp., which are environmental organisms phylogenetically related to M. tuberculosis (35, 37, 69).;  This suggests that rpoB mutation may have analogous effects on specific gene upregulation in M. tuberculosis.;  The M. tuberculosis genome has an extensive array of polyketide synthase genes (17), which have been shown in other bacteria to be involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including rifamycins (28). rpoB is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis, and clinically relevant rpoB mutations occur near the DNA-RNA channel of bacterial RNA polymerase (12, 64).;  In the current study, we compared the proteomes and metabolomes of paired wild-type and rpoB mutant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates to identify possible compensatory mechanisms important to drug-resistant isolates of the pathogen.;  Identification of these pathways may yield new drug targets and diagnostics that can improve treatment of patients infected with rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates.; All M. tuberculosis strains were obtained from patients being treated for pulmonary TB.;  An M. tuberculosis strain susceptible to all drugs tested (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) was obtained from a patient living in Costa Rica prior to initiating antitubercular therapy.;  Similarly, an M. tuberculosis strain susceptible to all drugs tested (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) was obtained from a patient in San Francisco prior to initiating standard first-line antitubercular therapy.; For laboratory-based rpoB mutant generation used in confirmatory experiments, an exponentially growing culture of the Johns Hopkins University wild-type laboratory reference strain M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (1) was inoculated onto 7H10 agar containing 1 μg/ml rifampin and incubated at 37°C for 21 days.; Spectra were subjected to interrogation against the M. tuberculosis genome (including the reverse strand) (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AL123456"",""term_id"":""444893469""}}AL123456, R9; 7,982 entries) using SORCERER (Sage-N Research, version 2.0) and SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, release 27, revision 12).;  Because rpoB mutation appears to significantly upregulate genes specifically involved in biosynthesis of natural product/secondary metabolites in other organisms (13, 34, 35, 37), we also used an automated approach to search the M. tuberculosis genome for gene clusters potentially associated with natural product biosynthesis (NP.searcher) (http://dna.sherman.lsi.umich.edu/; 49) and compared the expression of these gene clusters by mutants and wild-type M. tuberculosis using GSEA.;  After removal of the medium, the cells were incubated for 3 h with either wild-type M. tuberculosis or the rpoB mutant at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1.; To compare the proteomes of the Beijing and Haarlem strains of rpoB mutant, rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis to those of their wild-type progenitor isolates, proteins from four cellular fractions were extracted from late-log-phase broth cultures.;  The spectra were searched against the M. tuberculosis genome, and the total number of unique peptides identified in each cellular fraction of each biological replicate by strain type is shown in Table S3 in the supplemental material.;  All of the products identified at significantly higher spectral counts in the cell wall fractions of both rpoB mutant rifampin-resistant strains represented proteins that are transcriptionally coupled on a 50-kb region involved in the biosynthesis of PDIM in M. tuberculosis (10, 72), including two type I polyketide synthase genes (Rv2933/ppsC and Rv2935/ppsE) and a probable daunorubicin-dimycoserosate (DIM) transport protein (Rv2936/drrA).; Mean spectral counts and functional classes of proteins detected at statistically significantly higher spectral counts in specific cellular fractions of both rpoB mutant versus wild-type parent strains of M. tuberculosis;  Among the four gene loci identified as possibly involved in natural product biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis by NP.searcher, the polyketide synthase gene cluster ppsA-ppsE and drrA was significantly upregulated in both rpoB mutants (Fig. 1).;  Next, using qRT-PCR, we sought to determine the effect of rpoB mutation on the expression levels of selected PDIM biosynthesis genes during M. tuberculosis infection of activated murine macrophages.;  Finally, in order to confirm that the gene expression profile observed in the rpoB mutant was attributable to the RpoB S450L mutation in the rpoB gene, we experimentally generated a mutant strain containing the RpoB S450L mutation in the background of the laboratory strain M. tuberculosis CDC1551.; Effects of rpoB S450L mutation on M. tuberculosis gene expression and fitness. (A) Expression of the PDIM biosynthesis locus in the rpoB mutant Beijing strain relative to the rifampin-sensitive wild-type parent strain during logarithmic growth in nutrient-rich broth, as measured by RT-PCR. (B) Gene expression of the same strains after 72 h of infection in activated murine macrophages. (C) Growth and survival of the rpoB mutant (gray) relative to the Beijing wild-type parent strain (white) in activated murine macrophages. (D) RT-PCR analysis of gene expression in a laboratory-generated RpoB S450L mutant relative to the isogenic CDC1551 wild-type strain during logarithmic growth in nutrient-rich broth.; In addition to the proteomics experiments described above, metabolomics analyses were performed in order to determine if rpoB mutations also might lead to changes in the M. tuberculosis metabolome.;  This analysis revealed 99 molecular features in the chloroform fraction that were significantly more abundant (P < 0.05) in both rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains than in their susceptible counterparts (see Table S6 in the supplemental material).;  Since the proteomics and GSEA findings suggested that the polyketide synthase genes involved in phenolpthiocerol biosynthesis are upregulated in the rpoB mutant isolates of M. tuberculosis, we compared the chloroform extract to a positive authentic PDIM standard that was obtained from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and analyzed by LC-MS using identical parameters.; Metabolites identified as statistically significantly more abundant in both rpoB mutants versus wild-type parent strains of M. tuberculosis, with putative identifications; Representative spectra for some of the significant features found at higher abundance in the chloroform fraction of rpoB mutant versus WT susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates, which also matched peaks found in the PDIM standard.;  To determine if this compound originated from peptidoglycan (PG), an M. tuberculosis petidoglycan standard, obtained through the TVTRMC, was analyzed by LC-MS under identical conditions.;  An analysis of the literature for mass spectra of partially hydrolyzed PG demonstrated reports of PG N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNac) tetra- and pentapeptides and MurNac of M. tuberculosis PG that do match the molecular features observed in the spectra from our methanol sample fractions.;  An examination of the gene cluster associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis (Rv2158c-2152c) did not, however, reveal significantly increased spectral counts in the rpoB mutant isolates using GSEA.; We hypothesized that rpoB mutation would lead to upregulation of M. tuberculosis genes involved in secondary metabolism, given known relationships between rpoB mutation and upregulation of genes involved in natural product biosynthesis in other organisms (34, 35, 37).;  This study, which is the first to comprehensively compare the proteomes and metabolomes of rpoB mutant rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis with those of their paired wild-type rifampin-susceptible parent strains, supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that several genes, particularly those involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall lipids, including PDIM, are upregulated in rpoB mutants, both in broth culture and, in particular, when grown in murine macrophages.;  Using the program NP.searcher, we found 4 gene loci possibly related to natural product biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis, and the GSEA indicated that of these four, the proteins encoded by ppsA-ppsE and drrA were more abundant in the cell walls of both rpoB mutants than in those of their wild-type parent strains.;  Our study is different from previous studies demonstrating that exposure to rifampin induces several changes in rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis gene expression, including marked upregulation of drug efflux pump-related genes (30, 51).; Proteins encoded by ppsA-ppsE are involved in PDIM biosynthesis, and the corresponding genes are grouped on a 50-kb fragment of the M. tuberculosis chromosome (10).;  While we evaluated only two strains, the finding of similar changes in protein abundance in a Beijing and a Haarlem strain of M. tuberculosis with different rpoB mutations grown in the absence of drug exposure suggests that rpoB mutation and rifampin resistance in M. tuberculosis may lead to a pattern of differential protein and metabolite abundance that is conserved across both mutations and strains, but the extent of this effect may be related to the genetic background of the isolates.; PDIM is a long-chain β-diol (phthiocerol) esterified with two branched-chain mycocerosic acids located in the outer mycobacterial cell wall that has been implicated in M. tuberculosis virulence (11, 19, 59).;  Furthermore, M. tuberculosis strains with defects in this pathway have been shown to have increased cell envelope permeability (10) and are more susceptible to IFN-γ-mediated and IFN-γ-independent immunity (46, 56).;  Importantly, PDIM deficiency appears to be particularly important to M. tuberculosis growth in the host environment, as isolates with deficiencies in this pathway have pronounced growth defects in the spleens and lungs of infected mice (11, 19, 47) and are more susceptible to the nitric oxide-dependent killing of macrophages (61).;  More recently, PDIM has been shown to play a role in M. tuberculosis interaction with the host macrophage cell envelope, inducing changes that favor receptor-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium (2).;  In this study, we found that the upregulation of PDIM by rpoB mutants relative to WT isolates, initially identified by proteomics experiments on M. tuberculosis isolates grown in broth, was more dramatic when these comparisons were performed in activated murine macrophages.; rpoB mutant strains of saprophytic environmental mycobacteria have been found to cohabit with rifamycin-producing organisms on marine sponges (38), indicating that ancestors of M. tuberculosis faced rifamycin exposure long before this class of antibiotics was used to treat TB.;  Thus, it is possible that upregulation of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway in rpoB mutants of M. tuberculosis, as demonstrated here in both broth and macrophage culture, is a defense mechanism response to competition interference inherited from the environmental ancestors of M. tuberculosis.;  Although the physiological relevance of this gene upregulation to the human pathogen M. tuberculosis is unknown, it may be important to the survival of rifampin-resistant mycobacteria in the setting of rifamycin or other antibiotic exposure.;  In particular, future research should comprehensively investigate the degrees to which various globally heterogeneous strains of rpoB mutant M. tuberculosis upregulate PDIM, the mechanisms that result in PDIM upregulation, and the effect of rpoB mutation and PDIM upregulation on susceptibility to various stressors, including existing and novel antibiotics used to treat TB.; The M. tuberculosis genome contains an expansive repertoire of polyketide synthase genes that in related bacteria are involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites, including erythromycin A and rifamycin B (17, 28, 57).;  The finding of upregulation of several genes encoding polyketide synthases in both rpoB mutants of M. tuberculosis is of interest in that it suggests that the adaptive response of M. tuberculosis to rpoB mutation may be analogous to responses observed in related model organisms.;  Remarkably, while only certain rpoB mutations are associated with gene upregulation in model organisms, the specific mutations most commonly associated with induced gene expression in nonmycobacterial organisms (13, 35, 37) align with mutations most commonly found in clinical rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains (i.e., positions 445 and 450 in M. tuberculosis) (15, 32, 54, 70, 78).;  Although the limited sensitivity of shotgun proteomics approaches hinders our ability to definitively conclude that proteins found in the other two downstream PDIM transcriptional units were not also upregulated, these findings, together with the metabolomics data, suggest that the first transcriptional unit of the PDIM biosynthetic locus, and not the others, may be specifically upregulated in rpoB mutant isolates of M. tuberculosis.;  This indicates that PDIM production is not important for survival of environmental mycobacteria and, to the extent that the responses of M. tuberculosis to rpoB mutation may have been inherited from the saprophytic environmental ancestors of M. tuberculosis, provides one speculative explanation for the observation that intact PDIM was not found in greater amounts in rpoB mutant isolates in this study.; Domenech and Reed have shown that in vitro passage of M. tuberculosis H37Rv can lead to the inability of mycobacteria to produce PDIM (21).;  In the present study, clinical isolates from two different M. tuberculosis genotypes had minimal in vitro passage, and all of them showed the presence of PDIM when assessed by TLC (see Fig.; This comprehensive analysis suggests that further research to identify more precisely the effects of rpoB mutation on gene expression in M. tuberculosis will yield novel insights into diagnostics and treatments for drug-resistant TB.;  For example, if induction of PDIM biosynthetic pathways represents a compensatory virulence mechanism as a result of rpoB mutation, the development of novel drugs specifically targeting these pathways may be particularly effective when used to treat TB caused by rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis.;  Although the ppsA-ppsE genes are considered nonessential by transposon mutagenesis (64), Camacho et al. showed that mutant strains of M. tuberculosis with transposon insertions in the PDIM biosynthetic pathway were more sensitive to detergents than wild-type strains (10).;  Furthermore, if certain genes are expressed preferentially by rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, immune responses to the corresponding proteins could be investigated as a way to identify individuals with rifampin-resistant latent M. tuberculosis infection."

tumor,D009369,21672958,3125804,"Bacterial and fungal secondary metabolism is a rich source of novel bioactive compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications as antibiotics, anti-tumor drugs or cholesterol-lowering drugs.;  They belong to a wide variety of chemical classes, and many of them have cholesterol-lowering, anti-tumor or antibiotic activities."
tumor,D009369,29113654,5726560," Accumulating evidence demonstrates that specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract can potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms by damaging DNA, activating oncogenic signaling pathways, producing tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, and suppressing antitumor immunity.;  A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.; The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms, which can influence the immune system and health conditions, including cancer [3–5]. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet, lifestyle, and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms [6,7]. Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract [8,9].; Fusobacterium nucleatum expresses the FadA virulence factor on the bacterial cell surface, which has been shown to bind to CDH1, activate the WNT signaling pathway in colorectal carcinoma cells, and promote colorectal tumor growth [43]. The Fap2 protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum has been shown to interact with T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) receptor and inhibit the activities of NK cells and T cells [44]. Emerging evidence indicates that the Fap2 protein can potentiate the attachment of Fusobacterium nucleatum to colorectal cancers that express host polysaccharide Gal-GalNAc [45].; Intestinal bacteria produce diverse metabolites that can influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract tumors [4]. Polyamines, which are produced by host cells and gut bacteria, play important roles in diverse biologic and pathologic processes, including translation, gene regulation, stress resistance, and cell proliferation and differentiation [46]. Polyamines have been shown to suppress antitumor immunity and potentiate the proliferation of cancer cells, invasion and metastasis [47]. Colonic mucosal biofilms have been associated with up-regulation of polyamine metabolites that can enhance the proliferation of colon cancer cells [48].; Accumulating evidence indicates a link between secondary bile acids and the development of gastrointestinal tract tumors.;  Clinical studies have shown that high-fat diets can increase bile secretion [49] and that high faecal concentrations of bile acids are found in colorectal cancer patients [50]. Experimental studies have shown that lithocholic and deoxycholic acid can activate the NFKB signaling pathway in colonic epithelial cells [51,52] and that deoxycholic acid can potentiate the development of colorectal tumors in rats receiving azoxymethane (AOM), a colorectal carcinogen [53]. A study based on a mouse model suggests that deoxycholic acid can promote the development of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma by damaging DNA [54].; Accumulating evidence indicates that SCFAs such as butyrate, which are produced by the gut microbiota, can suppress colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis by blocking activation of the NFKB signaling pathway and inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing T cells [55–57]. Experimental studies have shown that butyrate can function as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation, stimulate apoptosis, and suppress colonic tumor development [58–61]. In contrast, emerging data demonstrate that low concentrations of butyrate may promote the growth of colonic tumors that exhibit DNA mismatch repair deficiencies in a mouse model [62].; Innate immunity is a rapid immune response that recognizes conserved microbial structures in a non-specific manner, typically through the action of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on host cells, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) [63]. Accumulating evidence indicates that TLRs contribute to the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract tumors through the activation of the NFKB and STAT3 signaling pathways [64]. The activation of TLR4, which is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide produced by the gut microbiota, in colonic epithelial cells has been shown to potentiate colorectal tumor development through the up-regulation of PTGS2 expression and activation of the EGFR signaling pathway in a mouse model receiving AOM [65]. Additionally, activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway has been shown to up-regulate TLR2 expression in gastric epithelial cells, which promote gastric tumor development, in a mouse model [66].; The NLR family is a group of receptor proteins that respond to intracellular fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan and initiate the NFKB and MAPK signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells [67]. Studies have shown that activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) in colonic epithelial cells can induce inflammation through the up-regulation of chemokine CCL5 and promote colorectal tumor development through the up-regulation of IL6 expression in the tumor microenvironment [68,69]. In the mouse model of colorectal cancer liver metastases, NLRP3 in Kuppfer cells increase the production of IL18, which can activate the function of NK cells and suppress colon cancer metastatic growth in the liver [70]. On the other hand, NOD2 can induce microbial dysbiosis and potentiate the development of inflammation-induced colorectal tumors through up-regulation of IL6 expression in colonic epithelial cells, suggesting a protective role for NOD2 in the maintenance of the composition of the gut microbiota [71].; Adaptive immunity is specific to the type of pathogen that is encountered by B and T cells with subsequent generation of memory cells [72]. The microbiota play an important role in the differentiation of T cells [4]. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota produce butyrate, which can induce the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing T cells through interactions with GPR43, activation of histone deacetylase inhibition, and up-regulation of IL10 expression [55]. Accumulating evidence indicates that T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which produce IL17 and IL22, can promote tumor development and progression in the gastrointestinal tract [73–75]. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis induces TH 17 cells, which activate the STAT3 signaling pathway in tumor cells in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of colon cancer [76,77]. TH 17 cells also produce IL22, which has been shown to promote colorectal tumor development and progression [78,79]. IL23, which is mainly produced by tumor-associated myeloid cells that are likely to be activated by bacterial products, has been shown to promote colorectal tumor development and progression through the induction of TH17 cells in the microenvironment [75,80,81]. Fusobacterium nucleatum may inhibit T-cell-mediated immune responses against colorectal tumors through the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into the tumor microenvironment in the ApcMin/+ mouse model [44,82]. Recent study has shown an inverse association between the amount of tissue Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA and CD3+ T-cell density in human colorectal cancer tissue specimens [83].;  Probiotics and prebiotics may restore the balance of normal gut microbiota, leading to a reduction in bacterial genotoxicity and tumor-promoting metabolites and to suppression of oncogenic signaling pathways.;  Antibiotics may be utilized to target genotoxic or deoxycholic acid-producing bacteria that have been shown to potentiate the development of gastrointestinal tract tumors.;  Hence, future investigations may be warranted to examine the potential influence of modifiable factors such as diet, probiotics and prebiotics, and antibiotics, on the intestinal bacteria and tumorigenic processes.; Yamamura et al. have reported that high amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with shorter cancer-specific survival and overall survival in esophageal cancers, including ESCC and EAC, and that the amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum correlates with tumor expression of chemokine CCL20.;  These results suggest that Fusobacterium nucleatum may contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior through activation of chemokines in esophageal carcinomas [93].; Clinical evidence suggests possible roles for specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in the development and progression of colorectal tumors (Table 3).; Case-control studies have shown that microbial diversity in tumor tissue or stool specimens is higher in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas cases than in controls [98–107]. These findings suggest an association between bacterial dysbiosis and the development of colorectal tumors.;  Studies suggest that enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is detected significantly more often in the colon mucosa tissue or stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls and that a higher amount of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is associated with advanced disease stage [116,128,129]. Although experimental studies suggest that Enterococcus faecalis may promote the development of gastric and colorectal tumors [14–18], one clinical study has suggested that Enterococcus faecalis is detected significantly more often in the stool specimens of colorectal cancer cases than in the controls [130]. Studies have demonstrated that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus in human colorectal carcinomas is higher than in control tissue and that the amount of Streptococcus gallolyticus is correlated with the expression of PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in colorectal cancer tissue [131–133]. These findings suggest a potential role of Streptococcus gallolyticus in the development of colorectal tumors through inflammation.;  However, there are considerable study-to-study differences regarding reported bacterial species associated with colorectal carcinogenesis, which may be due to limitations including small sample sizes, undefined tissue sampling sites, and limited data on clinical features and tumor molecular features.;  Colorectal cancers with unresectable distant metastases are treated with chemotherapy regimens that are based on oxaliplatin and irinotecan combined with molecularly targeted therapies such as a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGFA (bevacizumab) and anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab) [134]. ROS are important for DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxaliplatin [135]. The administration of oxaliplatin to germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice has been shown to reduce oxaliplatin-mediated tumor cytotoxicity by down-regulating the production of ROS in myeloid cells, suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of oxaliplatin for gastrointestinal cancer by modulating the production of ROS in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment [136]. Irinotecan is converted to its active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), which is subsequently detoxified to an inactive, glucuronidated form, SN38-glucuronide (SN38G), by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 [137,138]. The bacterial β-glucuronidase then deconjugates SN38G to SN38, the active form, in the gut, which can cause severe diarrhea [139]. Bacterial β-glucuronidase-selective inhibitors have been shown to reduce the incidence of irinotecan-induced diarrhea in mice [140]. Cyclophosphamide, which is a prominent alkylating anticancer agent and one of several clinically important cancer drugs, can promote the differentiation of TH17 cells that may stimulate antitumor immunity in melanoma [141]. In a mouse model of melanoma, cyclophosphamide has been shown to induce the translocation of several Gram-positive bacterial species, including Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus, and Enterococcus hirae, to secondary lymphoid organs, and the administration of cyclophosphamide to germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice has been shown to reduce the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide by inhibiting the differentiation of TH17 cells and the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ T cells, suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence cyclophosphamide-mediated anticancer immunity [142]. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota can influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.; Therapeutic antibodies specific for immune checkpoint molecules, including CTLA4, PDCD1 (programmed cell death 1; PD-1), and CD274 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; PD-L1) can effectively enhance antitumor T-cell activity in various cancers, underscoring an important role of T-cell–mediated adaptive immunity in inhibiting tumor progression [143–145]. Studies using a mouse model have shown that the oral administration of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or Bacteroides fragilis to germ-free mice can enhance the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for CTLA4 [146] and that the oral administration of Bifidobacterium can potentiate the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for CD274 [147]. These findings suggest that manipulating the gut microbiota may modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.; Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome develops early in life and that once established, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life [148]. However, diet, lifestyle, pharmacological factors (including antibiotics), and probiotics and prebiotics have been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota [149–153]. Although further studies using human tumor tissue specimens are required for clinical application, we hope to utilize the gut microbiota to modulate the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapies in the future.; Postoperative complications have been associated with tumor recurrence and a worse patient survival in gastrointestinal tract cancers [160–165]. Manipulating the gut microbiota by diet, lifestyle, antibiotics, and probiotics and prebiotics might become useful towards preventing the occurrence of postoperative complications and improving postoperative recovery after gastrointestinal tract surgery.; Accumulating evidence indicates that intestinal bacteria can influence the tumor development and progression in the gastrointestinal tract.;  Considering that diet, lifestyle, pharmacological factors (including antibiotics), and probiotics and prebiotics can influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota, future investigations may be warranted to examine the potential influences of these modifiable factors on the intestinal microflora and tumorigenic processes.;  Because the relationship between the complex gut microbiome and tumor cells in humans cannot be completely recapitulated in the mouse model, analysis using human cancer tissue is required for clinical application."
tumor,D009369,21116414,2993000," A number of biologically active compounds with varying degrees of action, such as anti-tumor, anti-cancer, anti-microtubule, anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, photo protective, as well as antibiotic and antifouling properties, have been isolated to date from marine sources.;  Coastal bacterial samples grown under saline conditions have been reported to yield new antibiotics, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory compounds [38–40]. In fact, the symbiotic microbial consortia also prove to be a source of bioactive compounds with pharmaceutical potential.;  These tambjamines have been isolated from marine invertebrates and have been previously reported to possess antimicrobial, antitumorigenic, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative and ichthyodeterrent activities [55]. Evidence points towards the colonizing bacteria at the surface of higher organisms as the source of these compounds [56]. This has further been proven by Burke and colleagues by elucidation of YP1 biosynthetic pathway in P. tunicata [57].;  It was isolated from a marine filamentous fungus, Aspergillus glaucus in the Fujian province of China, and was found to exhibit cytotoxicity against K562 and P388 cell lines [65]. The same group has recently worked on the antitumor activities of alkaloids isolated from a Penicillium sp. derived from deep ocean sediment.;  Many marine isolates of actinomycetes have been reported to be producers of novel antitumor [74], antimalarial [75] and antimicrobial agents [76,77].; In the exploration of marine derived actinomycetes as a source of antitumor compounds, Cho et al. (2007) isolated four new 3-methyl-4-ethylideneproline-containing peptides, Lucentamycins A–D from the fermentation broth of a marine derived actinomycete, Nocardiopsis lucentensis (strain CNR-712).;  These isolated compounds, when subjected to cytotoxicity analysis against 36 tumor cell lines, indicated significant cytotoxicity with great degree of selectivity for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer cells [79] suggesting their potential as anticancer drugs.;  The isolated tartrolon in this study was found to display strong cytotoxic activity against three human tumor cell lines viz. lung (A549), colon (HT29), and breast (MDA-MB-231) [80]. Yet another study reported the secondary metabolites of a marine Saccharomonospora sp. collected at the La Jolla Submarine Canyon.; Marine actinomycetes are not only known for their anti-tumor and anti-cancerous potential, they are well documented as antimicrobial agents too.;  All trioxacarcins showed high anti-bacterial activity whereas some of them showed high anti-tumor and anti-malarial activity [83]. In a latest study, crude extract of a marine Streptomyces strain obtained from deep sea sediments, was used to isolate five structurally similar compounds which were found to have potent antifouling activity [84].; Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria, also known as blue-green algae that produce an array of secondary compounds with selective bioactivity against vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, microalgae, fungi, bacteria, viruses and cell lines [86]. Some reviews in the past have proved that they produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites with antifungal, antiviral, antibiotic and other activities, which make them an interesting candidate of potential pharmaceutical importance [87,88]. Certain anticancer compounds, which were initially thought to be obtained from marine sources, are now known to be produced by cyanobacteria [89]. Ulithiacyclamide and Patellamide A belong to Cyanobactins, produced by cyanobacteria, which have potent antimalarial, antitumor, and multidrug reversing activities [90].;  They reported that Octalactin A exhibited strong cytotoxic activity towards B-16-FlO murine melanoma and HCT-116 human colon tumor cell lines with the IC50 values of 0.0072 and 0.5 pg/mL, respectively [106].;  Preclinical studies suggested this compound to be active against multi-drug resistant human tumor cell lines and it was observed to greatly enhance the efficacy when used in combination with the already existing chemo- or radio-therapy regimens in a variety of animal models [114,115]. Tasidotin, Synthadotin (ILX-651) derived from a marine bacterium is also under Phase II clinical trials with Genzyme Corporation (Cambridge, MA).;  Interesting properties such as a broader and longer lasting proteasome inhibition, efficacy against a wider range of hematologic malignancies and many solid tumor models, less cytotoxicity to normal cells, higher in vivo potency and potential for both oral and intravenous administration makes Salinosporamide A a very promising anticancer agent [115]. Bryostatin 1 is a well known marine anticancer agent, initially thought to be produced by Bryozoa.; Cyanobacteria produce a family of antitumor agents known as Cryptophycins, which interfere with the tubulin assembly."
tumor,D009369,21326924,3026423," Novel strategies also include the use of bacterial products such as proteins, enzymes, immunotoxins and secondary metabolites, which specifically target cancer cells and cause tumor regression through growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis induction.;  Coley, a surgeon in the Memorial Hospital in New York, described for the first time bacteria as anticancer agents.4 He observed that several patients showed tumor regression after being infected with pathogenic bacteria.;  Later, in 1935, Connell used sterile filtrates from Clostridium histolyticum to treat advanced cancers and observed tumor regression, which he pointed to be the result of enzymes' production.5 Many scientists since then, and even today, know that certain live, attenuated and engineered microorganisms such as Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Salmonella, Mycobacterium, Bacillus and Listeria have the ability to selectively target cancer cells and act as anticancer agents.;  They grow in the hypoxic core region of solid tumors, with very little oxygen and where most of the times radiation or chemotherapy are unsuccessful.6 Because of their selectivity for tumor micro-environment, these bacteria are also promising vectors for delivering therapeutic genes for anticancer therapies.; Clostridia are a group of anaerobes and, therefore, constitute an ideal tool to target solid tumors since in most cases these tumors show increased levels of hypoxia.7 In 1947, it was shown that the injection of spores of Clostridium histolyticus caused oncolysis, then referred to as “liquefaction,” of a transplanted mouse sarcoma.8Clostridium tetani spores were also used and tumor-bearing mice died 48 hours after the treatment in contrast to the healthy controls.9 This experience proved that a specific microenvironment is required to bacterial survival and development but also that toxicity remained a problem with live bacteria.;  Using Clostridium oncolyticum M-55, Carey et al. showed the benign activity of this strain by injecting themselves without any dangerous effect.10 It was tested against several transplanted tumors in different animal models and the results indicated the need of several conditions for the success: (1) a threshold in the tumor size (3 cm3 or 2 g of tumor weight); (2) a spore dose of 106–9 and (3) intratumoral or intravenous injection modes.5 A clinical trial using C. oncolyticum M55 spores to treat glioblastomas resulted in oncolysis with almost all gliobastomas converted into brain abscesses one week after injection.;  One of them consisted in the administration of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, an antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil (5-FU) and alkylating agents of the ethyleneimino type, which induced sarcoma regression in mice.13 Raising the temperature inside the tumors up to 42–44°C (hyperthermia) in combination with radiotherapy was another approach developed for C. oncolyticum M55, creating a more favorable environment for the development of the microorganisms.;  Mice bearing three different types of neck tumors (Ehrlich adenocarcinoma, Harding-Passey-melanoma and fibrosarcoma) were treated with this strategy, and in all cases tumor lysis was increased due to the bacteria development.14 A third approach developed was by the modification on the level of oxygen given, reducing its content in the air inhaled by the animals to 11–12%. Oncolysis was observed and 30% of the animals were cured with this approach.5 Nevertheless, these approaches were not very successful in their clinical outcomes since there was tumor recurrence in the patients from the viable outer rim of the tumor.7; In the middle of the last decade, the use of engineered Clostridial strains to increase anti-tumor effects gathered more attention.;  Saccharolytic, non-pathogenic strains were reevaluated and it was seen that spores of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 germinated in EMT6 tumor-bearing mice and spores of C. beijerinckii ATCC 17778, C. limosum DSM1400, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and NI-4082 germinated in WAG/Rij rats with syngeneic rhabdomyosarcomas.;  In all cases, vegetative bacteria were only present in tumor regions but not in healthy tissues.15,16C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was also used to clone Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD) and nitroreductase (NTR) genes, and in the presence of the correct prodrug, these enzymes were present in sufficient amount to induce EMT6 cells death.;  However, the studies showed that only intratumoral administration of the spores, but not intravenous, was able to produce a therapeutic effect.15,17 Genetically saccharolytic C. acetobutylicum strains containing cloned murine tumor necrosis factor α (mTNFα) or rat interleukin 2 (rIL2) were also constructed.;  The engineered strains gained the ability to produce significant amounts of these antitumor factors, but upon injection of the spores in rhabdomyosarcoma-bearing rats, tumor regression was not successful, even in combination with radiotherapy.;  This is likely to be due to the less ability of saccharolytic clostridia to colonize tumors when compared to proteolytic bacteria.18; Though proteolytic clostridia presented higher ability to colonize tumors, they were more difficult to manipulate.;  After a systemic administration of spores from both Clostridia types, tumor colonization from proteolytic Clostridia was about 1,000-fold higher than that of saccharolytic Clostridia.19 The proteolytic strain C. oncolyticum M-55 was transformed with a plasmid containing the CD gene and injected intravenously together with the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC).;  The results demonstrated higher antitumor activity than with other drugs tested, but failed to maintain the effect for more than one week, even though the bacteria remained in the tumor.;  More recently, this strain has been genetically engineered to overexpress the enzyme nitroreductase from Haemophilus influenza, producing better antitumor results.20; Volgstein et al. assessed the ability of several anaerobes in tumor therapy, using xenografted colorectal carcinoma, as model system.;  They compared 26 species belonging to the Clostridium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera and found two with higher tumor colonization capacity, namely Clostridium novyi and Clostridium sordelli.;  In spite of presenting this higher capacity, more than one third of the tumor-bearing mice injected with these spores died within 16–18 hours due to a lethal toxin (α) produced by the strains.;  This strain is very sensitive to oxygen and, thus, grows only in the core hypoxic region of the tumors.;  For this reason when it reached the well oxygenated rim area of the tumors, bacteria didn't survive thus tumor recurrence remained a concern.21,22 Resembling the other strains, alternative therapeutics were tested, combining the C. novyi-NT treatment with conventional chemotherapeutics (a strategy named COBALT—Combined bacteriological therapy).;  As example, the simultaneous use of the C. novyi-NT spores with a DNA-damaging drug and an anti-vascular agent, mitomycin C and dolastin-10, respectively, resulted in very satisfactory tumor shrinking, however it was always accompanied by severe toxicity.23; Other drugs were or are being tested in combination with these spores: taxanes like docetaxel and MAC-321 which are microtubules stabilizers and have demonstrated decreased toxicity, although with slow tumor regression.; Also, combinations of C. novyi-NT with radiotherapy were evaluated which showed positive effects in several tumor models.;  In solid tumors, radiation hits the rapidly proliferating and highly oxygen-exposed cells, and C. novyi-NT hits those cells resistant to radiation.5 The key advantage of this therapy is that the doses of radiotherapy can be much smaller than the ones used now, not damaging healthy tissues and with obvious advantages for patients' welfare.;  This is the most abundant genus inhabiting human colon and it has been used as a probiotic for many years.5 In the 1980s, it was shown that Bifidobacteria selectively grow in the hypoxic areas of solid mouse tumors upon intravenous injection of 5 × 106 cfu (colony forming units), and 96 hours after injection, virtually no bacteria were found in other tissues.24 Bifidobacterium not only inhibit cancer progression in mice but have also shown the ability to induce a powerful immune response, enhancing the killing activity of NK cells and recruiting the activity of IL-2, INFγ and INFα.25; Several genes have been cloned into natural Bifidobacterium plasmids. pBLES100 was used to clone spectinomycin adenyltransferase, transformed into B. longum 105-A or 108-A and introduced to tumor-bearing mice where they were found to colonize specifically tumoral tissues.26 The same thing happened when this strain was inoculated in rats with chemically induced tumors.26 Cytosine deaminase (CD) of E. coli was also cloned in pBLES100 under the control of a strong promoter (HU gene) and the B. longum strain carrying the recombinant plasmid was able to convert the prodrug 5-FC into 5-FU, suggesting the strain as an effective enzyme/prodrug therapeutic agent.27,28 The CD gene, cloned into the pGEX-1λT plasmid, was also transformed in B. infantis and the positive results obtained in a mice melanoma model also supported the hypothesis of using this genus in cancer gene therapy.29; Endostatin gene was cloned into the pBV220 plasmid and transformed into B. adolescentis and B. longum and both demonstrated the potential to induce tumor growth inhibition.;  Tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with this strain and sacrificed at several time points to analyze the tumor regression.;  Results indicated that almost all bacilli were specifically found in tumoral tissue region and only a few in apparently healthy tissues.33 Comparisons in tumor weight and volume were made between B. longum-TRAIL and B. longum-Endostatin, alone or in combination, with the best results being obtained with the combination.;  B. longum-Endostatin was also combined with Adriamycin (5 mg/kg) and its antitumor effect was enhanced.33; Salmonella species are facultative anaerobes known to selectively colonize tumoral cells of solid tumors showing a replication ratio between tumor and healthy tissues of 1,000:1.34 However, most strains are pathogenic, causing significant immunostimulation due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other virulence factors.5 To solve this problem, Salmonella thyphimurium was genetically modified in order to attenuate its virulence, disrupting the msbB gene, responsible for the terminal myristalization of lipid A, and purI, which introduced the need of an external adenine source.;  After showing the lower toxicity in several animal models, Pawelek and colleagues injected it into tumor-bearing mice and showed its specificity to tumors.35 Additionally, Salmonella strains were engineered to produce several proteins and toxins with anticancer activity: CD, TNFα, mitomycin C, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and colicin E3.;  More recently, reports have appeared of attenuated strains with the ability to delay tumor growth, including metastasis, in several models.5 A vaccine strain of Salmonella choleraesuis was developed and used both as a single anticancer agent and in combination with low-dose cisplatin (a platinum-based chemotherapy drug) in lung tumor and hepatocarcinoma in mice models.;  This strain was capable of delaying tumor growth in subcutaneous tumors and metastasis models.;  In combination with cisplatin, this strain increased the rate of infiltrating neutrophils, CD8+ T cells, enhancing an antitumor immune response and inducing a higher level of tumor apoptosis, causing an extended life span of the mice.36;  This strain is auxotrophic for leucine and arginine, but receives sufficient amounts of these amino acids from the tumor environment.37 Inoculation of wild type S. typhimurium caused death of the mice after only 2 days, but those inoculated with the A1 strain survived as long as the control mice.;  The ability of this strain to induce tumor regression was proved on a xenografted human prostate cancer.38 Although the results obtained with S. typhimurium A1 showed significant clinical potential, a new strain aiming at improving of the A1 tumor virulence was isolated.;  GFP expressing bacterial cells could then be isolated from the tumor tissue and cultured.;  Since it was a re-isolated A1 bacteria strain, the authors named it A1-R and both strains were compared in their adherence to tumor cells.;  Using the prostate cancer cell line PC3 as model, it was also seen that A1-R strain killed cancer cells in about 2 hours, whereas the strain A1 showed the same result only after 24 hours.39 The results obtained with A1-R were validated in other tumoral models.;  The same was verified in pancreatic tumors, where treatment with A1-R showed a clear reduction in the tumor size and in other primary tumoral models and metastases.40 As an example, A1-R strain has demonstrated increased tumor regression, decreased metastasis number and enhanced animal survival in primary osteosarcoma and respective lung metastasis,41 spinal cord glioma,42 experimental lymph node metastasis, and in lung metastasis.43;  It is an intracellular bacterium, capable of infecting phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells.44,45 Upon infection with Listeria, a significant immune response is elicited to clear the organism.46 A variety of live attenuated L. monocytogenes strains expressing viral and tumor antigens as fusion proteins have been produced during the last several years: HPV-16 E7,47 Her-2/neu,48,49 HMW-MAA,50 influenza NP51 and PSA.52,53 These recombinant strains cause specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice.;  Fusion of the antigens to a non-hemolytic truncated form of LLO resulted in enhanced immunogenicity and anti-tumor efficacy.47,49 It had the ability to induce inflammatory cytokines and an active strong immune response.;  Preclinical studies in several tumor models have proved the efficacy of this therapy.;  It also had the advantage of having already been found inside tumors and persisted in there for 10 days, while in the spleen and liver they only persisted for 3 days.54 Clinical trials using this bacterium have already been performed.;  Despite the encouraging effects in some tumor models, further clinical trials showed delayed hypersensitivity type reactions when tumor implantations were attempted in the locals of infection.6 In 1976, Alvaro Morales established a therapeutic protocol for bladder cancer treatment which took in consideration the time intervals needed for the hypersensitivity reactions to occur and considered, for the first time, intradermal BCG vaccination.;  Cancer metastasis occurs during tumor progression and cause 90% of human cancer deaths.;  The homing of metastases is not a random process, is organ specific, and depends on the histotype of the primary tumor.;  In this process, tumor cells use chemokine-mediated mechanisms.;  This is the case of the amino acid-degrading enzyme arginine deiminase of Mycoplasma arginini (Ma-ADI), a tumor growth inhibitor and potentially a therapeutic agent for the treatment of in vitro and in vivo tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer.72 Such inhibition of cancer cell growth by ADI is believed to be due to depletion of arginine.73 Interestingly, Ma-ADI has not only anticancer activity, but also has been implicated in inhibiting the growth of viruses such as HIV-1 and hepatitis C.74 These pleiotropic effects appear to suggest that the enzymatic activity of ADI, leading to arginine depletion, may not be the only contributing factor in the anticancer/antiviral activity of MA-ADI.;  To reduce immunogenicity, ADI was covalently bound to PEG 20,000 and renamed as ADI-PEG20 (Polaris, Inc.), maintaining approximately 50% of its specific activity and increasing half-life in the animal models.77 It was shown that ADI-PEG20 inhibited in vivo and in vitro growth of human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, which were found as auxotrophic for arginine due to a deficiency in ASS.78,79 Phase I and II clinical trials have been performed in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma.80–86 The results of the hepatocellular carcinoma showed only a moderate antitumor activity with tolerable toxicity, and in some cases, some patients couldn't complete the therapy as a result of allergic diseases.;  In the malignant melanoma clinical trials a higher anti-tumor activity was observed.86 Recent studies appear to indicate that a major advantage of ADI seems to be as a part of combinatorial therapies with interleukin 2, reducing the hypotension cause by nitric oxide, a common feature when high doses of IL-2 are given to patients, and its ability to cause nutritional stresses in cancer cells may be positive for the action of chemotherapeutic agents.; Clinical trials with different Exotoxin A-immunotoxins have already been performed with positive results in leukemia and bladder cancer.88–93 However, it was frequently observed that these immunotoxins missed the ability to exert a strong cytotoxic activity against solid tumors, with better results obtained with hematologic tumors.94 These cells are more accessible for immunotoxins than solid tumors because these proteins need to overcome several natural barriers, which leads to the loss of their efficacy.;  Manumycin A is an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces parvulus and is one of the most studied, which has shown both in vitro cytotoxic activity against several cell lines (human pancreatic tumor, thyroid carcinoma, leukemias, myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma) and in vivo against human cancer xenografted models (pancreatic cancer and thyroid cancer).100–107 A combined treatment with Manumycin and Paclitaxel (a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy), had a synergistic cytotoxic effect on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.107 Angiogenesis and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor are also inhibited by this combination, showing higher cytotoxic effects than when used singly.;  In this cancer model, xenografted tumors in nude mice have also been inhibited by this metabolite.108;  They show anti-tumor activity in cancer cell lines, many of those multidrug-resistant or paclitaxel-resistant (Taxol®, Bristol-Myers Squibb).114 Epitholones bind to the α, β-tubulin dimer of microtubules, inducing its polymerization and stabilization which causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition and apoptosis.;  These natural drugs have shown an average activity one order of magnitude more potent than taxanes in cancer cell lines with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the sub or low nanomolar range.117,118 In murine xenograft tumor models with both intravenous and oral administration of ixabepilone, a second generation epothilone B,118 successful tests have been conducted, particularly for multidrug resistant models, such as MCF7/ADR and 16C/ADR breast, Pat-7 ovarian and HCT116/VM46 human colon carcinoma.119 Breast cancer models of metastasis have striking tumor growth inhibition when treated with ZK-EPO.120 Different schedules for drug administrations have been reported for different cancer models in order to determine the maximum tolerated doses and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).;  Since J774 is a tumor cell line, it was of interest to see if azurin would demonstrate similar cytotoxicity towards human cancer cells.;  In addition, intraperitoneal administration of azurin in nude mice xenografted with the two human cancer cells led to statistically significant tumor regression in vivo, with no apparent toxic effects to the animals.122,124;  Azurin has been shown to bind avidly to the intracellular tumour suppressor p53, stabilizing it and, thus, leading to increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Bax-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells;122,123,127 it also binds to several Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, a family of extracellular receptor proteins known to be upregulated in many tumors,128 and this binding with EphB2 interferes in its phosphorylation at the tyrosine residue, resulting in inhibition of cell signalling and cancer growth (Fig. 1).6;  Azurin can enter the cancer cell to form a complex with tumor suppressor protein p53 (4 azurin molecules per 1 p53 molecule), stabilizing it and enhancing its intracellular level, which leads to apoptosis via caspase-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release pathways (A).;  These receptors are generally divided in two classes (A and B): A1 to A8 are cell-membrane linked proteins while B1 to B6 have highly conserved intracellular domains as well as a transmembrane domain.6 After the receptor-ligand interaction, a series of cellular signalling processes are initiated resulting in the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of many types of human tumors.;  Different Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are present in distinct locations and some have been shown to be upregulated in some tumors, as it was for the EphB2 which is upregulated in gliobastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastrointestinal and renal carcinomas, and prostate, lung and ovarian cancers.128 Chaudari et al.128 tested three different cupredoxin proteins which exhibited structural similarities with the ephrinB2 ectodomain and found high values of interaction between azurin and EphB2 and also EphA6, using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).;  However, since both EphB2 and azurin have been involved in cancer cell signalling or cancer cell death, the authors proposed that this interaction could be a way of blocking the signalling process, antagonizing the Eph-ephrin mediated tumor progression (Fig. 1).;  Altogether, the binding and the inhibition data indicate an affinity of azurin to interfere with the EphB2-ephrinB2 binding and the signalling process that can lead to tumor progression.128;  Azurin induces apoptosis through complex formation with tumor suppressor protein p53 or inhibits growth of cancer cells by interfering in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling or preventing angiogenesis.150 In vivo cancer regression by azurin has also been demonstrated."
tumor,D009369,25527542,4309719," A prominent example is colibactin, a largely unknown family of secondary metabolites produced by Escherichia coli via a hybrid NRPS-PKS biosynthetic pathway that inflicts DNA damage upon eukaryotic cells and contributes to colorectal cancer and tumor formation in the mammalian gut.;  These bacteria typically colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans, where the putative colibactins are hypothesized to exert genotoxic activity on host cells, resulting in DNA damage linked to tumorigenesis, colorectal cancer, and gut inflammation (28, 30, 31).;  Do the similar in vitro phenotypes caused by F. perrara and E. coli (Fig. 5) indicate similar functions of the Clb GI in vivo? For E. coli, it has been shown that the clb GI inflicts DNA damage and chromosome instability in the gut of mice, thereby contributing to inflammation-induced colorectal cancer and senescence-induced tumor growth (30, 31, 53)."
tumor,D009369,16988123,1612582," Athymic mice received control diets or diets containing 110 μmol/L or 263 μmol/L resveratrol, 2 wk prior to subcutaneous injection of the tumor cells.;  Metabolism of resveratrol was assayed by bolus gavage of 75 mg/kg resveratrol in tumor-bearing and nontumor-bearing mice.;  Pellets containing 10–100 mg resveratrol were implanted into the mice, next to newly palpated tumors, and tumor growth determined.;  Resveratrol, at any concentration tested, did not have a statistically significant effect on tumor growth.;  The higher levels of resveratrol tested (0.006% in food or 100 mg in slow-release pellets) tended to stimulate tumor growth (P = 0.08–0.09).;  Resveratrol and its major metabolites, resveratrol glucuronide and piceatannol, were found in serum, liver, skin, and tumor tissue.; In the past few years it has been discovered that resveratrol also has antitumor activity (8).;  Induction of in vivo apoptosis in tumor cells in rats as the result of resveratrol administration has also been reported (13).; Human melanoma is a tumor whose frequency is increasing at an alarming rate (14).;  After tumor formation, its volume (V = 1 × w2/2) was measured every second day using digital calipers.;  After tumor formation, its volume was measured every other day, as described above.;  At the end of 21 d, mice were killed by CO2 inhalation, tumors were removed and weighed, and the size of the implanted pellets was recorded.; Naïve or tumor-bearing male mice (28–33 g body weight) were administered resveratrol (75 mg/kg; 10 mL/kg) dissolved in 50% ethanol (in 0.9% saline) orally via a feeding needle (20 gauge).;  The tumor-bearing mice used for these studies were obtained from the control group at the end of the resveratrol feeding studies.;  Tissues (liver, skin, and tumors) were removed immediately following cardiac puncture, placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75°C until assayed.;  Tissue (liver, skin, and tumor) samples (200–300 mg) were homogenized (Tekmar Tissuemizer) in 500 μL cold acetone.;  Body weight and food consumption were determined daily for 3 d before tumor inoculation, and each day thereafter.;  All mice were killed by CO2 on d 21 following tumor inoculation and examined for pulmonary and extrapulmonary metastases according to previously described methods (23).; Data for tumor growth curves are presented as means ± SEM.;  Data analysis of the effect of piceatannol on B16 BL6 tumor metastases was analyzed by the Student’s t test, with P < 0.05 considered significant.;  Despite the 2-wk feeding of resveratrol in their semipurified diet, the mice in this group did not differ in tumor latency time compared with mice receiving the nonresveratrol supplemented semipurified diet (control, 7.6 ± 3.1 d; 0.025% resveratrol, 7.6 ± 0.5 d; 0.006%, resveratrol 7.3 ± 0.6 d).;  Mice fed the diet containing the highest amount of resveratrol had melanoma xenograft tumors that tended (P = 0.09) to grow faster than mice fed the control diet (Fig. 1A).; Effect of a resveratrol-containing diet (A) and slow-release resveratrol-containing pellets (B) on A375 human melanoma tumor xenograft growth in athymic mice.; Part of the explanation for these negative effects of resveratrol on tumor growth could be due to the rapid clearance and transformation of resveratrol.; Resveratrol and its metabolites in nontumor bearing athymic mice 5 min after a bolus of 75 mg/kg of resveratrol1; A similar experiment was conducted on the tumor-bearing control mice from the experiment described in Fig. 1.;  Plasma contained more resveratrol than liver, which is different from the experiment with nontumor-bearing mice (Table 2).;  The key finding is that the tumor contained a measurable amount of resveratrol, but it was only one-third the amount found in the skin.; Resveratrol distribution in tumor-bearing athymic mice 5 min after a bolus of 75 mg/kg1; To try and bypass the problem of resveratrol metabolism by the liver, we implanted slow-release resveratrol-containing pellets next to newly developing tumors.;  This method of delivering resveratrol did not inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 1B).;  As in the resveratrol-feeding experiment, mice receiving the highest concentration of resveratrol tended to have faster growing tumors (0.05 < P < 0.09).;  Nine days of treatment with 50 mg/kg piceatannol significantly increased the number of lung tumor colonies following intravenous injection of B16 BL6 melanoma cells (Table 3).;  One possible reason for the lack of inhibition of tumor growth could be our finding that resveratrol is rapidly cleared from the athymic mice and very little of it reaches the skin and tumor.; To circumvent the metabolism problem, we used slow-release resveratrol pellets implanted under the skin next to newly palpated tumors.;  However, the results of these experiments were similar to the feeding studies insofar as there was a nonstatistically significant trend for faster growing tumors in mice receiving the pellets containing the highest amount of resveratrol.;  These data confirm that the pellets released resveratrol in the immediate vicinity of the tumor.;  It is possible that this resulted from enhanced growth of micrometastases in the lung because the tumor cells were directly injected into the circulatory system, thus bypassing the steps of tumor invasion and extravasation.; There are several other reports that found resveratrol ineffective in inhibiting tumor growth in animal models despite its ability to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro.;  However, when these cells were grown subcutaneously in mice, resveratrol administration did not alter the growth of the tumor (27).;  Resveratrol also did not inhibit tumorigenesis in a chemically induced lung tumor model (28) or in a mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis (29).;  Although we used a 2-wk prefeeding period to mimic chemoprevention, the xenograft system could not adequately model spontaneous tumor development.;  One reason for the lack of growth inhibition in vivo may be the rapid clearance of resveratrol, so that biologically effective concentrations cannot reach the tumor.;  We speculate that this resveratrol metabolite may also stimulate the in vivo growth of human melanoma cells either directly or by causing the release of growth factors from nontumor cells in the microenvironment of the melanoma."
tumor,D009369,26703630,4728498," In preclinical studies, (+)-aeroplysinin-1 has been shown to have promising anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects.; Although pharmaceutical industry research of natural products has declined over the past 20 years [8], traditionally the majority of new drugs translated into the clinic are natural products or compounds derived from them [9]. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry is investing in the search for novel drug candidates from marine-derived organisms showing anti-angiogenic and/or anti-tumor activities.; The inflammatory response is a defense mechanism that protects against pathogenic organisms [35]. However, it is also related to allergy, pathological angiogenesis and tumor progression [36,37]. Once the inflammatory response is triggered, endothelial cells that are close to the inflammation focus release new inflammatory molecules and subsequently contributing to a positive feedback loop [38].;  Several reports have evaluated the (+)-aeroplysinin-1 activity in different tumor cell lines and its effects on specific molecular targets of tumors. (+)-Aeroplysinin-1 shows cytostatic [43] and cytotoxic effects (Table 4) on different types of tumor cells lines.; IC50 values of the anti-proliferative effect demonstrated for (+)-aeroplysinin-1 on different tumor cells.;  Akt and ERK are key effectors of the signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival [52]. Notwithstanding this lack of direct in vitro inhibitory effect of (+)-aeroplysinin-1 on these protein kinases, we could demonstrate that in both BAEC and HUVEC endothelial cells (but not in HCT-116 and HT-1080 tumor cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts) 2 h of treatment with 20 μM (+)-aeroplysinin-1 was enough to induce a strong decrease in the phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK [51]."
tumor,D009369,23481677,3705371, All isolated compounds revealed different biological activity spectra against a test panel of four bacteria: three fungi; two tumor cell lines and two enzymes.
tumor,D009369,26593927,4663560," Antibacterial and anti-tumor activities of compound 1 were measured against 15 drug-sensitive/resistant strains and 12 tumor cell lines.;  Moreover, it displayed remarkable anti-tumor activities; the highest activity was observed against the Jurkat cell line (human T-cell leukemia) with an IC50 value of 0.414 μM.; With the emergence of newer resistant forms of infectious diseases and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and tumors, it has become essential to develop novel and more effective antibiotics [1]. In recent years, numerous studies have discovered that marine-derived actinomycete strains, mainly Streptomyces species, have the ability to produce a wide variety of biologically active and structurally unique metabolites.;  Some of these compounds possess strong antibacterial and anti-tumor activities [2,3,4]. The immense diversity of marine actinomycetes, along with their underutilization, has attracted great attention from researchers to discover novel antibiotics [5,6,7,8].;  Our previous studies have shown that the secondary metabolites of this strain contain echinomycin, cyclic dipeptides, and esters [10]. Among these compounds, echinomycin, a bifunctional DNA intercalator, is the predominantly and biologically active constituent against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also shows good anti-tumor activity [11,12,13,14]. Our continued search for echinomycin analogues or other novel antibiotics from extracts of large scale fermentation led to the isolation of two new compounds quinomycin G (1) and cyclo-(l-Pro-4-OH-l-Leu) (2), as well as three known compounds tirandamycin A (3), tirandamycin B (4), and staurosporine (5) (Figure 1).;  In addition, antibacterial and anti-tumor activities of compound 1 were evaluated against 15 drug-resistant/sensitive strains and 12 tumor cell lines.; Meanwhile, compound 1 was also evaluated for anti-tumor activity in vitro against 12 human tumor cell lines (HCT-116, HepG2, BGC-823, NCI-H1650, A2780, SW1990, Mia-PaCa-2, U87 MG, SK-N-SH, Jurkat, ACHN, 786-O) by MTT method and echinomycin was used as the control.;  Compound 1 displayed strong anti-tumor activity against the tested cell lines ACHN, 786-O, U87 MG and Jurkat with the IC50 values of 0.552, 0.721, 0.627, and 0.414 μM, respectively.; Anti-tumor activities (IC50, μM) of compound 1 and echinomycin.; Antibacterial and anti-tumor assays were performed with compounds of purity >90% by HPLC.; The anti-tumor activities of the new compound 1 and echinomycin against 12 tumor cell lines including: human colonic carcinoma (HCT-116), human hepatoma (HepG2), human gastric cancer (BGC-823), human non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H1650), human ovarian cancer (A2780), human pancreatic cancer (SW1990, Mia-PaCa-2), human multiform glioblastoma (U87 MG), Human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH), human T-cell leukemia (Jurkat) and human renal clear cell carcinoma (ACHN, 786-O) were determined by MTT method [28,29,30,31].; Compound 1 exhibited moderate antibacterial and remarkable anti-tumor activities; however, its activities were lower than those of echinomycin, which indicated that the bicyclic peptide of these compounds was required for their activities.;  Echinomycin has been studied for many years and the mechanism of its antibacterial and antitumor activities is considered to be DNA bis-intercalation.;  Due to the similar structure, we proposed that compound 1 has a similar mechanism against the bacteria and the tumor cells.; X.Z., T.G. and P.Z. conceived and designed the experiments; X.Z., T.G. and F.L. performed the experiments; X.Z., T.G., F.L. and P.-C.Z. analyzed the data; W.-Q.Z. and Y.L. contributed the anti-tumor biassays; X.Z., T.G. and P.Z. wrote the manuscript."

tumor,D009369,19370169,2666887," We conclude that actinomycetes isolated from mangrove habitats are a potentially rich source for the discovery of anti-infection and anti-tumor compounds, and of agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes.; It is perhaps not surprising that novel marine actinomycetes are proving to be such a valuable source of new bioactive compounds [24–26] as actinomycete systematics is providing a taxonomic road map to genes hence products, including the discovery of first-in-class drug candidates [9, 27–29]. Indeed, an encouraging flow of novel anti-infection and anti-cancer compounds are being sourced from marine actinomycetes, as exemplified by the discovery of the abbysomicins, potent polycyclic polyketides active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and produced by “Verrucosispora maris” [30] and salinosporamide A, an anti-cancer compound produced by Salinispora tropica [31]. Marine Verrucosispora strains are also a source of novel proximicins, anti-tumor furan analogues of the antibiotic netropsin [32].;  Representative isolates found to be active against tumor cells and a diabetes related protein were fully characterized using established chemotaxonomic, morphological and molecular systematic methods.;  Three hundred and forty three strains showed activity against the tumor cell line (16.8%), 198 against S. aureus (9.7%), 101 against C. albicans (4.9%), and 59 against PTP1B (2.9%); only 3 isolates inhibited caspase 3.; The highest percentage of anti-tumor and anti- C. albicans activity was found with strains isolated from samples collected from Zhanjiang.;  However, it is also interesting that the Actinomadura, Nocardia and Nonomuraea isolates showed anti-tumor cell activity.; The most taxonomically diverse actinomycetes were those showed activity against the tumor cells.; Neighbor-joining tree based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showing relationships between the 26 selected actinomycetes found to inhibit tumor cells in vitro, and between them and the type strains of the highest 16S rDNA sequence similarity.;  Most of the Micromonospora strains which showed activity against tumor cells were isolated from the roots of mangrove plants, i.e., Acrostichum aureum (isolate160126), Acrostichum speciosum (isolate 160222), Cerbera manghas (isolate 162121), Lumnitzera racemosa (isolate 161022) and Rhizophora stylosa (162223).; Many of the strains isolated in the present study showed bioactivity against one or more of the screening systems, thereby underpinning and extending results from previous studies which showed mangroves to be a source of bioactive actinomycetes [14, 43]. Thus, 343 isolates showed activity against the tumor cell line (16.8%), 101 against C. albicans ATCC 10231(4.9%), 198 against S. aureus ATCC 51650 (9.7%), 59 against PTP1B (2.9%); but only 3 and 9 strains were active against caspase 3, and aurora kinase A, respectively.;  In contrast, representatives of seven genera, namely Actinomadura, Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nonomuraea, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and Verrucosispora, were active against the tumor cell line.;  The highest percentage of isolates showing anti-tumor and anti- C. albicans activity, for example, were from the Zhangjiang mangrove.;  Thus many of the streptomycetes which showed activity in the anti-tumor assay can be assigned to new species as they are separated from the type strains phylogenetic neighbors by sequence similarities well below those found between closely related Streptomyces species, such as those classified in the S. violaceusniger subclades [27, 28] and S. griseus [54]. The highest 16S rDNA sequence similarity to the valid species of Streptomyce violaeus of isolate 172614 and isolate 210701 were lower than 0.97 as 0.95 and 0.968, respectively.; It is evident from the 16S rRNA gene sequence data that many of the Micromonospora isolates active in the anti-tumor and PTP1B assays belong to putatively new species of this genus."

Notably, type III PKSs usually exhibit broad substrate promiscuity, and can recognize unnatural substrates to generate novel unnatural products, which renders them excellent candidates for enzymatic engineering to expand chemical space of polyketides [22, 23]. Several pyrone-encoding type III PKS have been identified.;  In addition, the availability of the vio gene cluster has enriched the diversity of type III PKSs, providing additional opportunities to biosynthetically engineer chemical diverse polyketides for drug development.; The two type III PKSs were identified from the S. somaliensis SCSIO ZH66 genome using the antiSMASH program [31]. orf assignments and their proposed function were accomplished by using the FramePlot 4.0beta (http://nocardia.nih.go.jp/fp4) [32] and Blast programs (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [33], respectively."

27903896,5210574," In order to advance the exploration of microbial secondary metabolism, we developed the largest publically available database of experimentally verified and predicted BCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc/).;  Here, we describe an update of IMG-ABC, which includes ClusterScout, a tool for targeted identification of custom biosynthetic gene clusters across 40 000 isolate microbial genomes, and a new search capability to query more than 700 000 BCs from isolate genomes for clusters with similar Pfam composition.;  These new tools and features add to the value of IMG-ABC's vast body of BC data, facilitating their in-depth analysis and accelerating secondary metabolite discovery.; In order to facilitate the discovery and analysis of BCs and SMs in bacterial genomes and metagenomes, a data mart called the Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters within the Integrated Microbial Genomes system (11) (IMG-ABC) was introduced in 2015 (12).;  The result of this integration was the growth of the IMG-ABC database to contain more than 730 000 BCs in 40 034 isolate microbial genomes and >310 000 BCs in 2416 metagenomes.;  IMG-ABC also provided the means to search these large datasets based on BC and SM attributes, such as BC type, Pfam (14) and EC content (15), BC length, SM activity etc.;  Here, we present an update of IMG-ABC, which includes several new features improving data mining and navigation, such as a set of tools for BC visualization and comparison, and targeted BC identification across thousands of isolate bacterial genomes with ClusterScout.; IMG-ABC can be accessed at https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc/ and can be browsed without a login requirement.;  However, creating a free IMG account enables users to utilize IMG-ABC's ‘BC Set’ feature, which allows saving groups of BCs on the server side for future retrieval and sharing.; In the initial version of IMG-ABC, users could search the BC database using various attributes, such as BC type, SM produced, or the presence of specific Pfams (14).;  Briefly, in order to find BCs with similar Pfam composition, Pfams assigned to the genes of the query BC are collected and searched against the IMG-ABC database for BCs containing at least three of these Pfams.;  In order to minimize the running time of the search, the ubiquitous ABC Transporter family (PF00005) is not considered at this step.;  Similar functionality in IMG-ABC is provided by ClusterScout, a tool that uses gene Pfam content for the identification of BCs across all publicly available isolate bacterial genomes in IMG.;  The results of a ClusterScout search are saved for up to 24 hours on the IMG-ABC server, so users are encouraged to download the results or, using a registered account, save them in a BC Set.; IMG-ABC case study. (A) The BC Cart is the virtual space where BC analysis can be performed. (B) The function heatmap visualization can be used to study the Pfam content of BCs.;  The green node represents experimentally verified BC for DAPG (from a gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens) in the IMG-ABC database.; The new version of IMG-ABC includes the BC cart, a feature familiar to IMG users (11), which serves to collect the BCs of interest for further in-depth analysis (Figure ​(Figure3A).3A).;  With this update of IMG-ABC, we are introducing the ability to visualize BC similarity networks (Figure ​(Figure3C)3C) by performing all-versus-all pairwise comparisons of selected BCs to create a similarity matrix.; To showcase the power of the new IMG-ABC features applied to a large database of annotated genomes we present a BC discovery and characterization case study using an example of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) biosynthesis, which is annotated by the current version of antiSMASH (13) as type 3 polyketide synthase cluster without SM product prediction.;  This search and subsequent analysis using IMG-ABC tools took less than an hour, and has led to the identification of putative DAPG biosynthesis clusters in four betaproteobacteria: a bacterium identified as Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans EGD-HP2 (19) and three members of Chromobacterium genus, Chromobacterium vaccinii MWU205 (20), C. vaccinii MWU328 (20) and Chromobacterium piscinae ND17 (21).;  This example demonstrates the power of IMG-ABC data and tools in supporting the analysis of genome sequences, enabling biological interpretation of sequence data and formulation of testable hypotheses.;  IMG-ABC contains the largest publicly available collection of experimentally identified and predicted BCs.;  Lastly, the content of the IMG-ABC database will be updated to include BC predictions from the latest version of antiSMASH, which not only includes more BC types in the identification algorithm, but also implements ClusterFinder to improve BC boundary prediction (13).;  IMG-ABC will continue to be provided to the users without the need for registration, making the exploration of global microbial secondary metabolism accessible to the entire scientific community.",ABC,cancer,,up

23708134,3719553," The antibiotic biosynthesis of M18 is coordinately controlled by multiple distinct regulatory pathways, of which the GacS/GacA system activates Plt biosynthesis but strongly downregulates PCA biosynthesis.;  Most secondary metabolic gene clusters, such as pvd, pch, plt, amb, and hcn, were activated by GacA.;  The GacA regulon also included genes encoding extracellular enzymes and cytochrome oxidases.;  Interestingly, the primary metabolism involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources was also notably regulated by GacA.;  Another important category of the GacA regulon was secretion systems, including H1, H2, and H3 (type VI secretion systems [T6SSs]), Hxc (T2SS), and Has and Apr (T1SSs), and CupE and Tad pili.;  More remarkably, GacA inhibited swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities.;  Taken together, the Gac-initiated global regulation, which was mostly mediated through multiple regulatory systems or factors, was mainly involved in secondary and primary metabolism, secretion systems, motility, etc., contributing to ecological or nutritional competence, ion homeostasis, and biocontrol in M18.;  Apart from the different and strong transcriptional regulation from all three P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) systems (Las, Rhl, and PQS) (11, 12, 15), antibiotic biosynthesis in the M18 strain is also subject to posttranscriptional regulation from the sRNA chaperone Hfq (16) and the Gac/Rsm signal transduction cascade (10, 17).; The well-known Gac/Rsm cascade has been characterized in detail in P. fluorescens CHA0 (18–20).;  The Gac/Rsm cascade is initiated by the Gac two-component regulatory system composed of the sensor kinase GacS and its corresponding response regulator, GacA.;  The GacS kinase responds to and senses an unidentified signal, causing the activation of the transcriptional regulator GacA through a phosphorelay mechanism.;  The active form of the GacA protein subsequently activates the transcription of the small RNAs (sRNAs) rsmXYZ.;  The modes of Gac system regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in M18 are both similar to and different from those in CHA0.;  Plt biosynthesis and its gene expression need activation by both the GacS/GacA global regulatory system (10) and the plt pathway-specific transcriptional activator PltR (21, 22).;  Moreover, one section of the activating pathway driven by Gac may be mediated by PltR (13).;  Intriguingly, the Gac system exerts strong downregulation on PCA biosynthesis through an uncharacterized mechanism (10).;  The Gac system also acts exclusively by controlling the transcription of sRNAs, RsmY, and RsmZ in P. aeruginosa PAK (24).;  The Gac/Rsm cascade covers a broad range of complex regulons regulating secondary metabolism and virulence factors.; During the long-term adaptation to rhizosphere environmental pressure, P. aeruginosa strain M18 may have evolved a unique set of secondary metabolic profiles involved in antibiotic biosynthesis and numerous corresponding global regulatory mechanisms, including Gac/Rsm (10, 17) and QS (11, 12, 15).;  The complex and diverse regulatory mechanisms of the Gac system in M18 urged us to analyze the global pattern of genomic expression of the gacA mutant and to further explore the importance of the Gac system to overall physiology and metabolism and the regulatory network of the Gac system.;  The results highlight a broader and more distinct regulatory profile of the GacS/GacA system in M18 than in Pf-5 and PAK.;  The Gac-controlled genotypic and phenotypic profiles predominantly included the secondary metabolism involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and extracellular enzymes as well as the primary metabolism involved in utilization of sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen, a large number of secretion systems, three types of motility, multiple regulatory factors or systems, etc.; The regulatory effect of GacA on three type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) was assessed by selecting hsiA1, hsiA2, and hsiB3, which correspond to the first genes of the hsiA1-hcp1, hsiA2-icmF2, and hsiB3-clpV3 operons located within the H1, H2, and H3 (T6SS) loci, respectively, in constructing the lacZ translational fusions in the pME6015 vector.; DNA microarray experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of GacA on the genome-wide transcription of P. aeruginosa M18.;  The transcriptome results were also confirmed by our previous report that the GacS/GacA two-component system (TCS) activated Plt biosynthesis and its operon expression and exerted strong downregulation on PCA biosynthesis and phz operon expression in M18 (10).;  The GacA regulon genes were grouped into 20 functional categories on the basis of PseudoCAP and were plotted with respect to downregulation and upregulation (Fig. 1A).;  The regulon under the positive control of GacA was mainly involved in secondary metabolism (51 genes), secretion systems (66 genes), cell membrane biogenesis (38 genes), etc.;  However, the negative regulon of GacA was predominantly involved in transcription factors and regulators (40 genes), amino acid transport and metabolism (34 genes), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (45 genes), etc. (Fig. 1A).; The well-characterized genes or gene clusters under GacA control are plotted in Fig. 1B.;  The secondary metabolic genes or gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of antibiotics (PCA, Plt, HCN, and AMB), siderophores (pyoverdine and pyochelin), and exoenzymes (alkaline protease, phospholipase C, chitinase, etc.) were strongly controlled by the Gac system.;  Surprisingly, the Gac system also exerted a significant influence on the primary metabolism involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus (phn, pst, and phoBR), sulfur (tau and ssu), and nitrogen (nor and nir).;  Many bacterial secretion systems also received strong and comprehensive regulation originating from GacA, including all three T6SSs (H1, H2, and H3), one T2SS (Hxc), two T1SSs (Has and Apr), one type I pilus system (CupE), and one type IVb pilus system (Tad).;  Among the genes in the GacA regulon, multiple operons encoding siderophores (pvd and pch) and hemophore (has) as well as phosphorus utilization operons (phn and pst) were established to play important roles in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis (36).;  The che2 chemotaxis operon (PAM18_0169 to PAM18_0178) was also shown to be subject to the positive control of GacA.;  Another important functional category occupying a large proportion of the GacA regulon was regulatory genes, such as two-component regulatory systems, transcriptional regulators, sigma factors, and regulators.;  This finding indicates that most members of the GacA regulon are likely under the indirect control of the Gac system.; In addition to plt and phz, the amb (PAM18_2734 to PAM18_2739) and hcn (PAM18_2842 to PAM18_2840) operons responsible for AMB and HCN biosyntheses, respectively, were also present among the positive regulons of GacA (Fig. 2E and ​andF).F).;  The Gac-initiated activation pathway of hcn expression was utilized as a classic model for clarifying the molecular regulatory mechanism of the Gac/Rsm cascade in CHA0 (20, 37).;  The expression of a functionally unknown gene cluster spanning from PAM18_1637 to PAM18_1629, which may be involved in secondary metabolism, was strongly positively regulated by GacA.;  These results indicate that the Gac system positively influences the biosynthesis of the siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin in M18, which is the opposite of the influence in P. protegens Pf-5 (23).; In addition to the antibiotic and siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters under GacA control, the expression of genes encoding some extracellular enzymes was also subject to Gac regulation.;  The Gac system regulated apr expression in the opposite directions between P. aeruginosa M18 and P. protegens Pf-5.; The GacS/GacA system is considered a master regulator of Pseudomonas secondary metabolism.;  Five compounds, including MgSO4, methionine, cysteine, SDS, and taurine, were used as the sole source of sulfur in assessing the influence of GacA on the sulfur utilization capacity of P. aeruginosa M18.;  These results, together with the transcriptome data, indicate that the primary metabolism involved in the uptake or catabolism of phosphonate, sulfonate, and nitrate compounds is also under the global regulation of the M18 Gac system.;  The control of primary metabolism by the Gac system may ultimately contribute to nutritional competition and ion homeostasis in P. aeruginosa M18.;  Among the T6SS regulons of GacA, the most significant downregulation at the transcript level was observed on the hcp genes encoding the secreted factor Hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein), including hcp1, hcp2, hcp3, hcpB, and hcpC (Fig. 6A to ​toD).D).;  These results clearly suggest that the Gac system positively controls the expression of T6SSs in P. aeruginosa M18.;  These results suggest that the Gac system positively controls the expression of the Has T1SS.;  In contrast, another T1SS (Apr) involved in alkaline protease secretion (44) was under the negative control of GacA (Fig. 2H).;  The downstream vreAIR operon encoding a cell surface signaling (CSS) system (46) was also strongly downregulated by GacA (Fig. 6F).;  The microarray result showed that the flp-rcp-tad locus was positively regulated by GacA (Fig. 6H).;  We measured the swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities of the gacA mutant and its parental strain, M18, in semisolid or soft agar to assess the influence of GacA on the motility of P. aeruginosa M18.;  Unexpectedly, among the GacA regulons of M18, no entire or partial motility-related gene clusters were negatively regulated by GacA.;  In contrast, gene clusters potentially related to bacterial motility, such as che2, were positively controlled by GacA.;  These results imply that the Gac system negatively controls the motility of P. aeruginosa M18 through a series of indirect and complex pathways or mechanisms.; The transcriptome profile revealed that 103 genes in the GacA regulon encode regulatory systems or factors, including 46 transcriptional regulators belonging to different families; 39 TCS elements; 15 sigma factors (RpoS, etc.), anti-sigma factors (VreR and FoxR), or sigma activators (Sfa2 and Sfa3); and 3 QS regulators (LasI, RsaL, and QscR).;  Among the TCSs regulated by GacA, PhoB/PhoR, NtrC/NtrB, PirS/PirR, and PAM18_2081/PAM18_2082 were significantly upregulated at the transcript level in the gacA mutant compared with their expression in wild-type strain M18.;  The sensor kinase-response regulator hybrid RetS, which is involved in the regulation of secretion system expression, exopolysaccharide production, and biofilm formation (51), was also positively regulated by GacA in M18.; In addition to TCSs, multiple CSS systems constituted a larger group of the GacA regulon, such as VreI-VreR-VreA, which upregulates the expression of the Hxc T2SS (46), FoxI-FoxR-FoxA (52), and two CSS-related systems, TonB2-ExbB1-ExbD1 and TonB4-ExbD2-ExbB2.;  In the transcriptome profile of M18, the largest family of transcriptional regulators under the control of GacA is the LysR family, which includes 11 genes.;  For example, the redox-sensitive transcriptional activator SoxR, a member of the MerR family, was negatively controlled by GacA.; The presence of multiple regulators within the GacA regulon implies that, in most cases, the GacS-GacA system may indirectly regulate various cellular processes and functions (e.g., bacterial metabolism, secretion systems, and motility) in M18 through the mediation of these regulatory systems or factors.;  Most of the above-mentioned regulators controlled by GacA in M18 are involved in the global or pathway-specific regulation of the Gac-controlled phenotypes in other Pseudomonas strains.;  Most GacA-regulated gene clusters include or link with one or more regulatory genes, such as pch (pchR) (Fig. 2B), phz2 (qscR) (Fig. 2D), plt (pltR) (Fig. 2C), pst (pstU and PAM18_5484) (Fig. 4B), phn (phnF) (Fig. 4A), the H1 T6SS (ppkA-pppA) (Fig. 6A), the H2 T6SS (stk1-stp1 and sfa2) (Fig. 6B), and the H3 T6SS (sfa3) (Fig. 6C).; The conserved Gac-Rsm signal transduction pathway, which is constituted by the two-component regulatory system GacS/GacA (BarA/UvrY in E. coli), the small RNAs RsmYZ (CsrB), and the translational repressor RsmA (CsrA), is typically involved in the regulation of virulence or biocontrol factors and carbon storage in many gammaproteobacteria (53).;  A general model of GacA-mediated global regulation in P. aeruginosa M18 is outlined in Fig. 9.;  The GacS/GacA system plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of diverse metabolic and physiological functions in the rhizobacterium P. aeruginosa M18, including secondary metabolism (involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, exoproducts, and siderophores), primary metabolism (involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources), ion homeostasis, ecological or nutritional competition, secretion systems, and cell motility (Fig. 9).;  The global transcriptional regulation driven by GacA is mostly mediated by many global or pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory systems or factors accounting for over 12% of all GacA regulons, such as transcriptional regulatory proteins of diverse families, TCSs, sigma factors or regulators, CSS systems, and QS systems.;  The Gac cascade, together with these regulatory systems and factors, is integrated into a cascaded and interwoven network to regulate globally a broad range of cell functions in M18.; General model of GacA-mediated global regulation in P. aeruginosa M18.;  The GacS/GacA two-component system, directly or indirectly through a large number of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulatory systems or factors, controls multiple sets of diverse biological processes, mainly including secondary metabolism, primary metabolism, bacterial secretion, and motility.;  Such culture conditions and such a sampling time were initially chosen for transcriptome profiling on the basis of the established viewpoint that the Gac system is a master regulatory system for Pseudomonas secondary metabolism (19).;  The transcriptome profile of P. protegens Pf-5 revealed that GacA significantly influenced the transcript levels of 635 genes.;  Three gene clusters, those for Plt, HCN, and H1 T6SS, are under the positive control of GacA in both strains (23).;  However, two siderophore gene clusters, pch and pvd, are positively regulated in M18 and negatively regulated in Pf-5 by GacA.;  In addition, a number of cytochrome c (cco) and o (cyo) oxidase genes involved in energy metabolism were under the similar control of GacA in both Pf-5 and M18.;  Apart from these common GacA regulons, in M18 a more extensive list of GacA regulons is involved in bacterial secretion (the H2 T6SS, H3 T6SS, Hxc T2SS, type I pilus CupE, and type IVb pilus Tad), secondary metabolism (amb and phz), and primary metabolism (phn, pst, ssu, tau, nir, and nor).; The transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAK revealed that 116 genes are positively controlled and 55 genes are negatively regulated (fold change, >2; P < 0.05) by GacA (24).;  Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of P. aeruginosa M18 and PAK revealed that 54 genes of the GacA regulon are under the common positive regulation of GacA in both strains (see Table S5 in the supplemental material).;  These GacA regulons with positive regulation include some genes of the H1 T6SS and H3 T6SS; the cat gene (PAM18_4330), encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; the sodM gene (PAM18_4559), encoding superoxide dismutase; etc. (24).;  However, only two genes and four genes were, respectively, commonly downregulated and reversely regulated by GacA in both strains (see Table S5 in the supplemental material).;  In the PAK strain, the Gac system negatively controls the type III secretion system, which is encoded by the genes psc, pcr, exs, and pop, and the pyrroloquinoline quinone genes pqqABCDE (24).; Typically, the GacS/GacA TCS plays an important role in the transition from primary to secondary metabolism and the control of the production of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes involved in biocontrol or pathogenicity and ecological fitness or competition (19, 53).;  This study shows that the Gac system regulates not only the secondary metabolism involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, siderophores, and extracellular enzymes but also the primary metabolism involved in the transport and metabolism of phosphate, sulfonate, and nitrogen compounds in P. aeruginosa M18.;  This observation implies another important function of the Gac system in ion homeostasis and the nutritional starvation response.;  For example, the PhoR/PhoB TCS, which is negatively controlled by the Gac system in M18, globally regulates the expression of phn, pst, phoBR, and other pho regulons in bacteria.;  All three modes of bacterial motility are repressed by the Gac system in M18.;  Instead, the motility-related che2 chemotaxis operon (54) was shown to be positively regulated by GacA in M18.;  Only a few individual motility-related genes, such as the two-component sensor gene fleS, the flagellar gene fliS, and the monorhamnolipid biosynthetic operon rhlAB, were shown to be under the negative regulation of GacA.;  In agreement with the negative control of M18 swarming motility by GacA, RsmA, as a downstream element of the Gac/Rsm cascade, positively controls the swarming ability of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (55).;  The GacS/GacA TCS in P. fluorescens F113 represses swimming motility via the KinB/AlgB TCS (56).;  However, it remains unknown whether the Gac system represses motility through KinB/AlgB in M18.;  In contrast to the Gac repression of F113 motility, the gacA mutant almost entirely impairs the swarming motility but does not obviously influence the swimming motility of the rhizobacterium P. protegens Pf-5 (23).;  Therefore, further research is needed to clarify the molecular regulatory mechanism of the Gac system on the motility of P. aeruginosa M18.; In conclusion, the GacS/GacA two-component system of P. aeruginosa M18 globally controls multiple sets of diverse biological processes, including secondary metabolism, primary metabolism, bacterial secretion, and motility, which contribute to ecological fitness or competence, ion homeostasis and nutritional competence, biocontrol or pathogenesis, etc.;  The P. aeruginosa PAK Gac system exerts direct transcriptional control only on the expression of sRNAs RsmYZ and thus posttranscriptionally regulates many relevant target genes or gene clusters.;  However, in M18, it remains unknown whether all GacA regulons involved in structural and regulatory functions are exclusively regulated via the Gac/Rsm cascade, composed of three different components, the GacS/GacA two-component system, the sRNAs RsmY and RsmZ, and the RNA-binding repressor RsmA.;  Identification and characterization of more direct target genes of each component in the Gac/Rsm system and their downstream key regulators should be conducted through the use of high-throughput technologies, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology, RNA sequencing, and interactomic techniques, to distinguish the Gac/Rsm-derived direct regulatory pathways from indirect pathways.;  Therefore, further research is needed to understand the complex regulatory pathways and networks that are commonly made up from the Gac/Rsm cascade and other global or pathway-specific regulatory systems or factors, such as other TCSs, QSs, CSSs, sRNAs, transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulators of different families, etc.",Gac,twitching motilities,,down
28784988,5547118," Further characterization of several other berberine-utilizing bacteria and the genes encoding key demethylenation enzymes revealed that these enzymes are tetrahydrofolate dependent and similar to demethylation enzymes such as GcvT.; The amino acid sequence of CDS6194 has 44–50% identity with the T-protein of the glycine cleavage system (GcvT), which is expected to function as a THF-dependent aminomethyltransferase in various bacteria (Supplementary Table 1).;  Interestingly, BrdA proteins of these BBR-degrading bacteria are similar to the THF-dependent GcvT protein of various bacteria.;  Among the THF-dependent GcvT homologous enzymes, only four enzymes (SesA from Sinomonas sp. no. 22, DesA and LigM from Sphingobium paucimobilis SYK-6 and DmdA from Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062) have been characterized.; In this study, we demonstrated that four species of BBR-degrading bacteria (two Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria) harbor enzymes that cleave the methylenedioxy ring of BBR; these enzymes are similar to GcvT, the THF-dependent demethylenase that is involved in glycine metabolism.;  By contrast, bacteria that have evolved to utilize BBR might have developed GcvT-like enzymes for demethylation and demethylenation without oxidation.",GcvT,stress,,up
23708134,3719553," Another important category of the GacA regulon was secretion systems, including H1, H2, and H3 (type VI secretion systems [T6SSs]), Hxc (T2SS), and Has and Apr (T1SSs), and CupE and Tad pili.;  Many bacterial secretion systems also received strong and comprehensive regulation originating from GacA, including all three T6SSs (H1, H2, and H3), one T2SS (Hxc), two T1SSs (Has and Apr), one type I pilus system (CupE), and one type IVb pilus system (Tad).; The Has type I secretion system (Has T1SS) HasDEF is responsible for the secretion of the hemophore HasAp (heme acquisition protein), which binds heme from hemoglobin and is then taken up via the cell surface receptor HasR in P. aeruginosa (44).;  The most significant downregulation of the gacA mutation was found at the transcript level of the gene encoding HasAp (Fig. 6E).;  These results suggest that the Gac system positively controls the expression of the Has T1SS.;  Similarly, the regulatory role of gacA on two type I secretion systems, the Apr T1SS and the Has T1SS, in M18 is opposite of that in Pf-5 (23).",Has,twitching motilities,,up

 Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 290: G30–G35, 2006.) impaired butyrate absorption in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells due to decreased MCT1 level at the apical cell surface following enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infection.;  Current studies, therefore, examined the potential role of probiotic Lactobacilli in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and counteracting EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function.;  Of the five species of Lactobacilli, short-term (3 h) treatment with L. acidophilus (LA) significantly increased MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells.;  Heat-killed LA was ineffective, whereas the conditioned culture supernatant of LA (LA-CS) was equally effective in stimulating MCT1 function, indicating that the effects are mediated by LA-secreted soluble factor(s).;  Furthermore, LA-CS increased apical membrane levels of MCT1 protein via decreasing its basal endocytosis, suggesting that LA-CS stimulation of butyrate uptake could be secondary to increased levels of MCT1 on the apical cell surface.;  LA-CS also attenuated EPEC inhibition of butyrate uptake and EPEC-mediated endocytosis of MCT1.;  Previous studies from our laboratory and others suggested monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1) to play a key role in mediating H+-coupled absorption of human colonic luminal butyrate (22, 33, 34).;  Various studies have also shown differential regulation of MCT1 to impact colonic epithelial health.;  In fact, downregulation of MCT1 expression and/or activity has been reported in mucosal inflammation (41, 42), colon cancer (12, 19), and in response to infection by enteropathogenic E. coli (4), an important human enteric pathogen causing infantile diarrhea.;  On the other hand, various studies showed upregulation of MCT1 expression and/or activity in response to various agents, such as luminal leptin (9), somatostatin (36), butyrate (7, 11), and via nutrient-sensing mechanisms (6).;  In this report, we have demonstrated upregulation of MCT1 activity by the bioactive soluble factors secreted by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) via increasing the levels of the transporter at the apical cell surface.;  These factors also alleviated enteropathogenic E. coli-induced inhibition of MCT1 activity.; Apical uptake of 14C-butyrate was measured as described previously (6), in the presence or absence of pCMBS, a specific inhibitor of MCT1.;  After immunoprecipitation of biotinylated antigens with neutravidin agarose, biotinylated proteins were released by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then probed with anti-MCT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).;  The surface MCT1 was compared with total cellular MCT1, as determined by immunoblotting of the solubilized cell extract.;  Cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for endocytosed MCT1, as described above.; In the initial set of studies, we used five species of Lactobacilli, as outlined in materials and methods, to examine their short-term treatment effects on MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake in postconfluent Caco-2 cell monolayers.; Short-term treatment with L. acidophilus (LA) and L. casei (LC) stimulates monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells.;  MCT1 function [p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate (pCMBS)-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake] was determined and calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.;  We have also determined LA-CS effects on MCT1 function in T-84 cells, another human intestinal epithelial cell line, and observed significant increase in pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake following LA-CS treatments for 3 h (in nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1: control, 1.62 ± 0.08 vs.;  These results suggest that LA-CS effects in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake are not cell line specific.; Culture supernatant of LA, but not heat-killed bacteria, mimics the effects of live bacteria on MCT1 function: postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with live or heat-killed LA (overnight cultures diluted to 600-nm absorbance = 0.2), or bacteria-free culture supernatant of LA (LA-CS) (diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F-12).;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; To examine the mechanisms of butyrate enhancement of MCT1 function, we performed kinetic analysis of LA-CS effects on butyrate uptake.;  As shown in Table 1, LA-CS treatment caused significant increase in Vmax of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and a decrease in Km.;  Increased Vmax could imply increased MCT1 levels at the cell surface, whereas decreased Km suggests increased affinity of MCT1 for the substrate.; We next utilized cell surface biotinylation to measure apical membrane levels of MCT1 in response to LA-CS treatments.;  Consistent with increased function, LA-CS treatment (3 h) significantly increased apical membrane MCT1 levels (Fig. 3A).;  To examine whether LA-CS-mediated increase in apical membrane MCT1 is via decreasing basal endocytosis of MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization assay to measure endocytosed MCT1 fraction in the presence or absence of LA-CS.;  As shown in Fig. 3B, LA-CS significantly decreased basal MCT1 endocytosis, suggesting that increased cell surface MCT1, at least partially, is due to decreased endocytosis in response to LA-CS treatments.; LA-CS increases apical surface MCT1 level via decreasing endocytic internalization.;  A: Caco-2 monolayers (14-day postplating) were treated with LA-CS for 3 h, and apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell surface biotinylation.;  B: following surface biotinylation, Caco-2 monolayers were incubated with LA-CS at 37°C for 3 h, and endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  EPEC infection for 30 min substantially inhibited MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake (Fig. 4), as was also shown in our previous studies (4).;  On the other hand, LA-CS also attenuated EPEC-induced inhibition of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake.;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was determined and calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; Our earlier studies have shown that EPEC inhibition of butyrate uptake was associated with decreased MCT1 levels on the apical cell surface (4).;  Therefore, we examined whether LA-CS could counteract EPEC-induced internalization of surface MCT1.;  As shown in Fig. 5A, LA-CS alone increased the level of surface MCT1 and also blocked the EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1.; LA-CS attenuates EPEC-induced decrease in cell surface MCT1 via counteracting EPEC-induced MCT1 endocytosis.;  Apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell-surface biotinylation.;  Top: the band intensities of apical vs. total MCT1 in different groups.;  Endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  Top: the band intensities of endocytosed vs. total MCT1 in different groups.; To examine the mechanisms of LA-CS alleviation of EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization studies utilizing reversible biotinylation.;  As shown in Fig. 5B, EPEC infection increased the endocytosed fraction of MCT1 compared with control.;  LA-CS not only decreased basal endocytosis, but also counteracted EPEC-induced endocytosis of MCT1.;  In this regard, studies from our laboratory and others have shown MCT1 to play a major role in the absorption of colonic luminal butyrate (17, 22, 33, 34).;  Impaired butyrate absorption secondary to downregulation of MCT1 has been reported in inflammation (41, 42) and colon cancer (12, 19).;  We have also shown inhibition of MCT1 function in response to infection by EPEC (4), a food-borne pathogen causing early diarrhea, more particularly in children.;  Therefore, agents that upregulate MCT1 activity and/or correct MCT1 dysfunction could be of therapeutic value for intestinal inflammatory disorders associated with impaired butyrate absorption.;  In the present report, we have shown short-term effects of the probiotic LA in stimulating butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical membrane.;  Our laboratory's recent studies have also shown LP stimulation of Na+-coupled butyrate uptake in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells via upregulation of sodium-coupled MCT1 (SMCT1) expression (2).;  SMCT1 is a relatively recently characterized transport protein implicated in Na+-coupled transport of butyrate across colonic luminal membrane (21).;  Therefore, it seemed logical to us to investigate the effects of probiotic Lactobacilli species on MCT1 activity.;  Interestingly, LP showing long-term effects in increasing SMCT1 expression and function in IEC-6 cells, and mouse colon, as reported earlier (2), had no effects on MCT1 function.;  On the other hand, LA, another species of Lactobacilli, increased MCT1 function via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical cell surface.;  Additionally, heat-killed LA did not affect MCT1 function, whereas bacteria-free LA-CS had the same stimulatory effects on MCT1 function as that of live LA, suggesting the role of LA-secreted soluble factors in mediating the beneficial effects on MCT1 function.;  LA-CS-induced activation of MCT1 function in polarized Caco-2 cells was kinetically manifested by increased Vmax and decreased Km.;  Increased Vmax suggests that LA-CS-induced increase in the absorptive capacity of MCT1 was due to its increased apical membrane abundance, which was also supported by our cell surface biotinylation studies.;  Endocytic internalization studies further suggested that increased apical membrane localization of MCT1 could, at least partially, be due to LA-CS inhibition of basal MCT1 endocytosis.;  The observed decrease in Km in response to LA-CS treatments could indicate increased affinity of MCT1 for butyrate.;  However, potential alternative mechanisms of LA-CS effects, such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MCT1, could also account for the observed effects on the Km.;  Furthermore, altered interactions of MCT1 with CD147, an auxillary glycoprotein known to play critical role in membrane targeting of MCT1 (26), need to be examined to account for LA-CS enhancement of apical membrane levels of MCT1.; Our results showed that LA-CS not only stimulates MCT1 function and membrane expression, but also counteracts EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function and EPEC-mediated endocytic internalization of MCT1 from apical cell surface.;  Since bacteria-free LA-CS itself could counteract EPEC inhibition of MCT1 activity and live LA was not required, the effects were presumably not due to pathogen exclusion, but rather via induction of signaling events that modulated MCT1 intracellular trafficking mechanisms.;  These and other relevant signaling events could also play important roles in mediating LA-CS effects on MCT1 endocytosis and recycling under basal conditions or in response to EPEC infection.;  Therefore, our studies showing positive effects of probiotic-secreted molecules on the functionality of MCT1, a major player in mediating cellular entry of luminally produced butyrate, have great implications in colonic epithelial health and integrity.",MCT1,colonic,,up

 In this report, we have demonstrated upregulation of MCT1 activity by the bioactive soluble factors secreted by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) via increasing the levels of the transporter at the apical cell surface.;  These factors also alleviated enteropathogenic E. coli-induced inhibition of MCT1 activity.; Apical uptake of 14C-butyrate was measured as described previously (6), in the presence or absence of pCMBS, a specific inhibitor of MCT1.;

 We have also determined LA-CS effects on MCT1 function in T-84 cells, another human intestinal epithelial cell line, and observed significant increase in pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake following LA-CS treatments for 3 h (in nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1: control, 1.62 ± 0.08 vs.;  These results suggest that LA-CS effects in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake are not cell line specific.; Culture supernatant of LA, but not heat-killed bacteria, mimics the effects of live bacteria on MCT1 function: postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with live or heat-killed LA (overnight cultures diluted to 600-nm absorbance = 0.2), or bacteria-free culture supernatant of LA (LA-CS) (diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F-12).;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; To examine the mechanisms of butyrate enhancement of MCT1 function, we performed kinetic analysis of LA-CS effects on butyrate uptake.;  As shown in Table 1, LA-CS treatment caused significant increase in Vmax of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and a decrease in Km.;  Increased Vmax could imply increased MCT1 levels at the cell surface, whereas decreased Km suggests increased affinity of MCT1 for the substrate.; We next utilized cell surface biotinylation to measure apical membrane levels of MCT1 in response to LA-CS treatments.;  Consistent with increased function, LA-CS treatment (3 h) significantly increased apical membrane MCT1 levels (Fig. 3A).;  To examine whether LA-CS-mediated increase in apical membrane MCT1 is via decreasing basal endocytosis of MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization assay to measure endocytosed MCT1 fraction in the presence or absence of LA-CS.;  As shown in Fig. 3B, LA-CS significantly decreased basal MCT1 endocytosis, suggesting that increased cell surface MCT1, at least partially, is due to decreased endocytosis in response to LA-CS treatments.; LA-CS increases apical surface MCT1 level via decreasing endocytic internalization.;  A: Caco-2 monolayers (14-day postplating) were treated with LA-CS for 3 h, and apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell surface biotinylation.;  B: following surface biotinylation, Caco-2 monolayers were incubated with LA-CS at 37°C for 3 h, and endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  EPEC infection for 30 min substantially inhibited MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake (Fig. 4), as was also shown in our previous studies (4).;  On the other hand, LA-CS also attenuated EPEC-induced inhibition of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake.;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was determined and calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; Our earlier studies have shown that EPEC inhibition of butyrate uptake was associated with decreased MCT1 levels on the apical cell surface (4).;  Therefore, we examined whether LA-CS could counteract EPEC-induced internalization of surface MCT1.;  As shown in Fig. 5A, LA-CS alone increased the level of surface MCT1 and also blocked the EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1.; LA-CS attenuates EPEC-induced decrease in cell surface MCT1 via counteracting EPEC-induced MCT1 endocytosis.;  Apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell-surface biotinylation.;  Top: the band intensities of apical vs. total MCT1 in different groups.;  Endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  Top: the band intensities of endocytosed vs. total MCT1 in different groups.; To examine the mechanisms of LA-CS alleviation of EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization studies utilizing reversible biotinylation.;  As shown in Fig. 5B, EPEC infection increased the endocytosed fraction of MCT1 compared with control.;  LA-CS not only decreased basal endocytosis, but also counteracted EPEC-induced endocytosis of MCT1.;  In this regard, studies from our laboratory and others have shown MCT1 to play a major role in the absorption of colonic luminal butyrate (17, 22, 33, 34).;  Impaired butyrate absorption secondary to downregulation of MCT1 has been reported in inflammation (41, 42) and colon cancer (12, 19).;  We have also shown inhibition of MCT1 function in response to infection by EPEC (4), a food-borne pathogen causing early diarrhea, more particularly in children.;  Therefore, agents that upregulate MCT1 activity and/or correct MCT1 dysfunction could be of therapeutic value for intestinal inflammatory disorders associated with impaired butyrate absorption.;  In the present report, we have shown short-term effects of the probiotic LA in stimulating butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical membrane.;  Our laboratory's recent studies have also shown LP stimulation of Na+-coupled butyrate uptake in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells via upregulation of sodium-coupled MCT1 (SMCT1) expression (2).;  SMCT1 is a relatively recently characterized transport protein implicated in Na+-coupled transport of butyrate across colonic luminal membrane (21).;  Therefore, it seemed logical to us to investigate the effects of probiotic Lactobacilli species on MCT1 activity.;  Interestingly, LP showing long-term effects in increasing SMCT1 expression and function in IEC-6 cells, and mouse colon, as reported earlier (2), had no effects on MCT1 function.;  On the other hand, LA, another species of Lactobacilli, increased MCT1 function via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical cell surface.;  Additionally, heat-killed LA did not affect MCT1 function, whereas bacteria-free LA-CS had the same stimulatory effects on MCT1 function as that of live LA, suggesting the role of LA-secreted soluble factors in mediating the beneficial effects on MCT1 function.;  LA-CS-induced activation of MCT1 function in polarized Caco-2 cells was kinetically manifested by increased Vmax and decreased Km.;  Increased Vmax suggests that LA-CS-induced increase in the absorptive capacity of MCT1 was due to its increased apical membrane abundance, which was also supported by our cell surface biotinylation studies.;  Endocytic internalization studies further suggested that increased apical membrane localization of MCT1 could, at least partially, be due to LA-CS inhibition of basal MCT1 endocytosis.;  The observed decrease in Km in response to LA-CS treatments could indicate increased affinity of MCT1 for butyrate.;  However, potential alternative mechanisms of LA-CS effects, such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MCT1, could also account for the observed effects on the Km.;  Furthermore, altered interactions of MCT1 with CD147, an auxillary glycoprotein known to play critical role in membrane targeting of MCT1 (26), need to be examined to account for LA-CS enhancement of apical membrane levels of MCT1.; Our results showed that LA-CS not only stimulates MCT1 function and membrane expression, but also counteracts EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function and EPEC-mediated endocytic internalization of MCT1 from apical cell surface.;  Since bacteria-free LA-CS itself could counteract EPEC inhibition of MCT1 activity and live LA was not required, the effects were presumably not due to pathogen exclusion, but rather via induction of signaling events that modulated MCT1 intracellular trafficking mechanisms.;  These and other relevant signaling events could also play important roles in mediating LA-CS effects on MCT1 endocytosis and recycling under basal conditions or in response to EPEC infection.;  Therefore, our studies showing positive effects of probiotic-secreted molecules on the functionality of MCT1, a major player in mediating cellular entry of luminally produced butyrate, have great implications in colonic epithelial health and integrity.",MCT1,inflammation,,up

 Current studies, therefore, examined the potential role of probiotic Lactobacilli in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and counteracting EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function.;  Of the five species of Lactobacilli, short-term (3 h) treatment with L. acidophilus (LA) significantly increased MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells.;

 Furthermore, LA-CS increased apical membrane levels of MCT1 protein via decreasing its basal endocytosis, suggesting that LA-CS stimulation of butyrate uptake could be secondary to increased levels of MCT1 on the apical cell surface.;

 On the other hand, various studies showed upregulation of MCT1 expression and/or activity in response to various agents, such as luminal leptin (9), somatostatin (36), butyrate (7, 11), and via nutrient-sensing mechanisms (6).;  In this report, we have demonstrated upregulation of MCT1 activity by the bioactive soluble factors secreted by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) via increasing the levels of the transporter at the apical cell surface.;  These factors also alleviated enteropathogenic E. coli-induced inhibition of MCT1 activity.; Apical uptake of 14C-butyrate was measured as described previously (6), in the presence or absence of pCMBS, a specific inhibitor of MCT1.;  After immunoprecipitation of biotinylated antigens with neutravidin agarose, biotinylated proteins were released by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then probed with anti-MCT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).;  The surface MCT1 was compared with total cellular MCT1, as determined by immunoblotting of the solubilized cell extract.;  Cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for endocytosed MCT1, as described above.;

23457254,3624589," Using a combination of microarray and metabolite analyses, we demonstrate that the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 are both dependent on the PA2449 gene.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene was found to influence the transcription of a core set of genes encoding a glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and serine dehydratase.;  PA2449 also affected the transcription of several genes that are integral in cell signaling and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  PA2449 is conserved among pseudomonads and might be universally involved in the assimilation of glycine among this metabolically diverse group of bacteria.;  The putative transcriptional regulator PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was not only necessary for the production of pyocyanin but also essential for the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source.;  Understanding the relationship between glycine metabolism, pyocyanin biosynthesis, and the PA2449 gene was the main goal of the current study.;  Importantly, the results of our study provide a foundation for defining the role of PA2449 in the general metabolism and physiology of Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The DNA region containing the putative PA2449 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR.;  The gel-purified PA2449 PCR product was cloned into pCR-Blunt to give the plasmid pBRL408.;  The PA2449 ORF was subcloned from pBRL408 into the NdeI/EcoR I restriction sites of pET28b (Novagen) to yield the plasmid pBRL417.;  Subsequently, pBRL417 was digested with XbaI and SacI to liberate the PA2449 ORF with a 5′ ribosome binding site (RBS), which was then ligated into the XbaI/SacI sites of pBBR1MCS-5 to generate the plasmid pBRL435.; In addition to being a putative TyrR-like protein, the PA2449 protein also possesses homology to transcriptional regulators known as enhancer binding proteins (EBPs) that interact with the alternative sigma factor σ54 (RpoN) to activate transcription (40).;  The RpoN interaction domain is conserved in the PA2449 protein(see Fig.;  Because the PA2449 protein displays homology to both PhhR (44% identity) of P. aeruginosa and TyrR (41% identity) of E. coli, we suspected that PA2449 might also be involved in phenazine biosynthesis.; A P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain possessing a transposon insertion within the PA2449 gene was obtained from the P. aeruginosa PAO1 transposon mutant library (33).;  Therefore, because of the historical importance of PIA, we focused our experiments on defining the relationship between the PA2449 gene and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown in gelatin-based PB.;  Expression of the PA2449 ORF from the lac promoter of pBBR1MCS-5 (pBRL435) restored PCA and pyocyanin biosynthesis in PW5126.;  These data indicate that production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 requires the PA2449 gene.; To verify that the pyocyanin deficiency of PW5126 was the result of the transposon insertion in the PA2449 gene, the PA2449 ORF of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was cloned into the broad-host-range vector pBBR1MCS-5 and the resulting plasmid (pBRL435) was electroporated into PW5126.;  Nonetheless, the sole expression of the PA2449 ORF was sufficient to restore pyocyanin production in PW5126, thus confirming that a functional PA2449 gene is required for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  This indicated that PCA biosynthesis was still operative in the absence of PA2449, albeit at extremely low levels.; It was initially believed that the absence of the PA2449 gene could disrupt the biosynthesis of key metabolites, e.g., chorismate, that are necessary for the production of phenazines.;  We next examined if the PA2449 gene was necessary for activating or upregulating the expression of genes required for phenazine biosynthesis.;  This change in phzB1, phzB2, and phzM expression was not observed for the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  Expression of the phzH-lacZ construct was not affected by the PA2449 mutation (Fig. 3D).;  Our concern was therefore that the pyocyanin-deficient phenotype of PW5126 was due to low or insufficient levels of HSLs, e.g., C4-HSL, as a result of the PA2449 mutation.;  However, the exogenous addition of HSLs to PW5126 cultures did not restore pyocyanin production, thereby suggesting that involvement of PA2449 is more complex than simply via HSL mechanisms.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene did not appear to have an overall negative effect on quinolone biosynthesis.;  A more detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of individual PQS signaling molecules is required to gain an accurate picture on how the disruption of the PA2449 gene affects the PQS network in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The assimilation of glycine as a carbon source was dependent on the PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  In conclusion, the PA2449 gene was essential for the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on glycine as a sole carbon but not a nitrogen source.;  The elevated glycine concentrations generated in PW5126 cultures are indicative of a deficiency in glycine assimilation and are consistent with PA2449 being involved in glycine metabolism for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; PA2449 was observed to be essential for both pyocyanin biosynthesis and the utilization of glycine, and its deletion had a deleterious effect on the synthesis of C4-HSL.;  To elucidate how these processes are related through the PA2449 gene, we used microarrays to determine the transcriptome of PW5126.;  It was expected that the resulting transcriptomic data would provide key information on the involvement of PA2449 in both glycine assimilation and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; As established earlier, disruption of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL in PB.;  The microarray data also provided some insight into how the disruption of PA2449 may exert its influence on C4-HSL biosynthesis.; Selected list of genes having >2-fold changes in transcript levels in a transposon insertion PA2449 mutant (PW5126) compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in PB; In sharp contrast to the overabundance of genes regulated by C4-HSL signaling identified in the microarray experiments, only a limited number of genes represent potential candidates of PA2449 regulation and are restricted to those involved in glycine metabolism (Fig. 6).;  On the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, the PA2449 gene is localized near a gene cluster that encodes proteins involved in glycine and serine metabolism: gcvT2 (PA2442), sdaA (PA2443), glyA2 (PA2444), gcvP2 (PA2445), and gcvH2 (PA2446).;  These data and the previous observation that PA2449 was essential for glycine utilization support a probable role for PA2449 in regulating glycine metabolism in P. aeruginosa PAO1, possibly through facilitating the transcriptional activation of the gcvT2, sdaA, glyA2, gcvP2, and gcvH2 genes.; Key pathways of glycine assimilation that might be regulated by PA2449 in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Several genes whose products are predicted to be involved in glycine/serine metabolism were observed to be transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of a functional PA2449 gene.;  A follow-up lacZ reporter assay of the hcnA promoter confirmed that its activation was PA2449 dependent (Fig. 7B).;  PA2449 might provide another layer of regulation, which mediates the expression of hcnABC in the presence of excess intracellular glycine in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Examination of the metE-lacZ reporter revealed it to be activated only in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 7C); there was a >90% decrease in expression from the metE promoter in the absence of PA2449.;  It is probable that PA2449 positively regulates the expression of metE to increase metabolic flux from glycine to methionine.;  These findings indicate that the decreased expression of metE observed from PW5126 is due to elevated intracellular concentrations of glycine/serine, which could not be sufficiently metabolized in the absence of PA2449.;  Coordinating the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus with the activation of genes whose products function in SAM biosynthesis, e.g., metE and gcvT2H2P2, via PA2449 could mutually enhance pyocyanin biosynthesis.;  Whether PA2449 functions in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the production of C4-HSL and pyocyanin requires further exploration.; Serine dehydratase (encoded by sdaA) is necessary for the optimal growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in PB. (A) Pyocyanin production from P. aeruginosa mutants possessing transposon insertions within genes that are potential candidates of regulation by PA2449.; Proposed models for PA2449 in regulating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL and pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Transcription of mexEF-oprN, encoding an efflux pump, is repressed by PA2449.;  This prevents the efflux of intracellular PQS, thus enhancing the expression of rhl-related genes and phenotypes, including phenazine production. (B) The PA2449 protein directly activates the transcription of the C4-HSL synthase gene, rhlI, thereby facilitating the expression of the rhl network. (C) PA2449 operates independently of the rhl network to activate the expression of phz-related genes for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; The PA2449 gene, which encodes a putative TyrR-like transcriptional regulator, was essential for P. aeruginosa PAO1 to assimilate glycine as a carbon source.;  Disruption of the PA2449 gene also reduced the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on both serine and valine when either one was supplied as a carbon source.;  In contrast, the necessity of the PA2449 gene for optimal growth on valine cannot be readily explained and remains unclear.;  The PA2449 gene was not required for the utilization of any amino acid, including glycine and serine, as a source of nitrogen.;  This suggests that a possible function of PA2449 is to aid in the metabolism of glycine as a carbon but not nitrogen source for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; Microarray analysis revealed that the disruption of the PA2449 gene affected the transcription of genes encoding proteins of a glycine cleavage system (GcvT2, GcvH2, and GcvP2), a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA2), and a serine dehydratase (SdaA).;  Dysregulation of the glyA2 and sdaA genes would limit the metabolic flux of serine into glycine or pyruvate, respectively. glyA2 and sdaA dysregulation could account for the reduced growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on serine (as a carbon source) in the absence of PA2449.; Whether the PA2449 protein functions as a direct transcriptional activator for any of the genes located within the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus remains to be answered.;  However, the only genes related to glycine metabolism that were transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of PA2449 were gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 and glyA1.;  For example, the transcription of other choline-related catabolic genes (63), including sdaB and soxBDAG, was unaffected by the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Lastly, the transcription of genes whose products could participate in glycine metabolism, e.g., glyA3 and gcvP1H1T1 (PA5213 to PA5215), was unaffected by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene.; PA2449 may provide another tier of transcriptional regulation of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus.;  For example, PA2449 might upregulate the transcription of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus to ensure that the resulting GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA pathway has sufficient activity to meet the cellular demands associated with having to assimilate glycine as the only available carbon source.;  The PA2449 gene is conserved among pseudomonads, in which it lies in proximity to genes encoding a serine dehydratase and/or glycine cleavage system.;  The regulation of glycine and possibly serine catabolism by PA2449 might therefore be a universal phenomenon among Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was completely dependent on the PA2449 gene regardless of environmental conditions.;  Under a variety of different growth conditions and medium formulations, the PA2449 gene was essential for the production of pyocyanin.;  Specifically, the PA2449 gene was required for the transcriptional activation of genes, i.e., phzA1, phzA2, and phzM, necessary for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.;  Without the PA2449 gene, the basal level of transcription of the phz genes was sufficient for allowing the production of PCA at trace quantities.;  We later found that the cause for the decreased transcription of the phz genes in the absence of PA2449 was insufficient levels of C4-HSL (discussed below), which is involved in phz gene activation.; This study characterized the relationship between the PA2449 gene and the production of pyocyanin under nutritionally poor growth conditions, i.e., glycine was the predominant source of carbon, phosphate was in limiting concentrations, and both aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids were in scarce supply.;  Because glycine (serine) is a biosynthetic precursor to thiols/purines and a product of protein turnover, a reduction in these processes could cause a gradual increase in intracellular glycine (serine) concentrations that is eventually countered by PA2449.;  Metabolomic analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at the onset of pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation is required to validate the existence of such a scenario involving PA2449-directed glycine metabolism.; The inactivation of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL from P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  These findings indicate that the pyocyanin-null phenotype associated with the disruption of the PA2449 gene is a result of low or insufficient levels of C4-HSL, which consequently prevent RhlR from transcriptionally activating the phz genes required for pyocyanin biosynthesis.; Although we established that the production of C4-HSL requires a functional PA2449 gene, the reasoning or mechanism(s) underlying their relationship has not yet been determined.;  The data presented herein show that PA2449 is necessary for the catabolism of glycine as a carbon source, but QS also has also been shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in glycine metabolism (65).;  It is possible that glycine metabolism might be transcriptionally regulated only through QS in which PA2449 acts as an intermediary for facilitating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL in response to glycine availability.;  However, ΔrhlR, ΔlasR, and ΔrhlR ΔlasR P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants readily grew on minimal media with glycine as the sole carbon source; a trait not shared by the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  This suggests that glycine metabolism is dependent on PA2449 through mechanisms apart from QS in P. aeruginosa PAO1.; The necessity of the PA2449 gene, and possibly glycine metabolism, for the biosynthesis of C4-HSL is an intriguing question.;  In support of this mode of inhibition, we did observe that the transcription of the methionine synthase gene, metE, was repressed either by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene or through the exogenous addition of glycine/serine to P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures.;  However, the addition of methionine or heterologous expression of the E. coli metE gene in the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant did not restore C4-HSL to levels sufficient for triggering the production of pyocyanin.; The reduced production of C4-HSL in the absence of the PA2449 gene could be attributed to the decreased transcription (>3-fold) of the C4-HSL synthase gene rhlI.;  The role of PA2449 in the transcription of rhlI was narrowed down to a few possible factors (Fig. 9).;  First, we observed elevated transcription (>50-fold) of the pump-encoding mexEF-oprN genes with the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Therefore, PA2449 might function in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the accumulation of intracellular PQS for activation of the rhl network and subsequent C4-HSL biosynthesis (Fig. 9A).;  If indeed this is the mode of regulation by PA2449 of rhlI expression, it is expected that deletion of the mexEF-oprN locus in the PA2449 mutant (PW5126) will restore intracellular PQS to levels sufficient for mediating C4-HSL biosynthesis.;  Closer inspection of a ΔPA2449 ΔmexEF-oprN P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant for these physiological traits is an objective of future studies.; How PA2449 affects transcription of mexEF-oprN is unclear.;  Perhaps the PA2449 protein functions as this “unknown” repressor protein to facilitate the biosynthesis of C4-HSL under nutrient-poor conditions.;  In addition, the transcription of mexS (PA2493) genes was upregulated by 12-fold in the absence of PA2449.;  An additional regulator, MvaT (PA4315), which affects the expression of several QS-related genes such as mexEF-oprN (68), was not observed to be differentially transcribed between wild-type cells and the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  The mechanism by which PA2449 regulates the mexEF-oprN locus is currently being investigated.; In addition to influencing the transcription of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump genes, the PA2449 protein might serve as a direct transcriptional activator for the rhlI gene (Fig. 9B).;  The PA2449 protein is predicted to be an EBP, so it is plausible that it interacts with RpoN to mediate expression of the rhlI locus.;  Further in-depth studies will clarify the role of PA2449 in the production C4-HSL for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; This study characterizes the physiological and genetic effects of a transposon deletion PA2449 mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The PA2449 gene is predicted to encode either a TyrR or EBP type transcriptional regulator.;  This ambiguity is due to the fact that the PA2449 protein possess homology to both the TyrR protein of E. coli and the EBP PhhR of P. aeruginosa.;  However, an alignment between these three proteins shows that the primary sequence of the PA2449 protein is 44% identical to that of PhhR and 41% identical to that of E. coli TyrR.;  Additionally, there is a stretch of ∼8 amino acid residues unique to only the PA2449 protein and PhhR.;  Several of the genes that are potentially regulated by the PA2449 protein, including gcvH2, phzB1, and rhlI, possess putative RpoN promoters (http://www.sigma54.ca/promoterdata/Web/data.aspx).;  These data support a probable role for the PA2449 protein as an EBP that interacts with RpoN to mediate transcription under conditions in which glycine is the predominant carbon source.; To biochemically characterize and verify that the PA2449 protein behaves as an EBP, it is imperative to determine the intracellular signal(s) sensed by this protein.;  Our data clearly show that PA2449 is involved in glycine metabolism, so an obvious candidate for triggering the PA2449 protein into an active state is glycine or possibly its metabolic counterpart serine.;  The PA2449 protein may interact with a specific THF derivative, thus activating expression of GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA and subsequently restoring balance to the THF pool.;  PA2449 was involved in C4-HSL biosynthesis by possibly augmenting the PQS response.;  Does the PA2449 protein respond to PQS? We are currently examining the biochemical function of the PA2449 protein and attempting to define its in vivo targets in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown under glycine-rich, pyocyanin-producing conditions.",PA2449,infection,,up
23457254,3624589," Using a combination of microarray and metabolite analyses, we demonstrate that the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 are both dependent on the PA2449 gene.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene was found to influence the transcription of a core set of genes encoding a glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and serine dehydratase.;  PA2449 also affected the transcription of several genes that are integral in cell signaling and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  PA2449 is conserved among pseudomonads and might be universally involved in the assimilation of glycine among this metabolically diverse group of bacteria.;  The putative transcriptional regulator PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was not only necessary for the production of pyocyanin but also essential for the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source.;  Understanding the relationship between glycine metabolism, pyocyanin biosynthesis, and the PA2449 gene was the main goal of the current study.;  Importantly, the results of our study provide a foundation for defining the role of PA2449 in the general metabolism and physiology of Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The DNA region containing the putative PA2449 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR.;  The gel-purified PA2449 PCR product was cloned into pCR-Blunt to give the plasmid pBRL408.;  The PA2449 ORF was subcloned from pBRL408 into the NdeI/EcoR I restriction sites of pET28b (Novagen) to yield the plasmid pBRL417.;  Subsequently, pBRL417 was digested with XbaI and SacI to liberate the PA2449 ORF with a 5′ ribosome binding site (RBS), which was then ligated into the XbaI/SacI sites of pBBR1MCS-5 to generate the plasmid pBRL435.; In addition to being a putative TyrR-like protein, the PA2449 protein also possesses homology to transcriptional regulators known as enhancer binding proteins (EBPs) that interact with the alternative sigma factor σ54 (RpoN) to activate transcription (40).;  The RpoN interaction domain is conserved in the PA2449 protein(see Fig.;  Because the PA2449 protein displays homology to both PhhR (44% identity) of P. aeruginosa and TyrR (41% identity) of E. coli, we suspected that PA2449 might also be involved in phenazine biosynthesis.; A P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain possessing a transposon insertion within the PA2449 gene was obtained from the P. aeruginosa PAO1 transposon mutant library (33).;  Therefore, because of the historical importance of PIA, we focused our experiments on defining the relationship between the PA2449 gene and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown in gelatin-based PB.;  Expression of the PA2449 ORF from the lac promoter of pBBR1MCS-5 (pBRL435) restored PCA and pyocyanin biosynthesis in PW5126.;  These data indicate that production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 requires the PA2449 gene.; To verify that the pyocyanin deficiency of PW5126 was the result of the transposon insertion in the PA2449 gene, the PA2449 ORF of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was cloned into the broad-host-range vector pBBR1MCS-5 and the resulting plasmid (pBRL435) was electroporated into PW5126.;  Nonetheless, the sole expression of the PA2449 ORF was sufficient to restore pyocyanin production in PW5126, thus confirming that a functional PA2449 gene is required for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  This indicated that PCA biosynthesis was still operative in the absence of PA2449, albeit at extremely low levels.; It was initially believed that the absence of the PA2449 gene could disrupt the biosynthesis of key metabolites, e.g., chorismate, that are necessary for the production of phenazines.;  We next examined if the PA2449 gene was necessary for activating or upregulating the expression of genes required for phenazine biosynthesis.;  This change in phzB1, phzB2, and phzM expression was not observed for the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  Expression of the phzH-lacZ construct was not affected by the PA2449 mutation (Fig. 3D).;  Our concern was therefore that the pyocyanin-deficient phenotype of PW5126 was due to low or insufficient levels of HSLs, e.g., C4-HSL, as a result of the PA2449 mutation.;  However, the exogenous addition of HSLs to PW5126 cultures did not restore pyocyanin production, thereby suggesting that involvement of PA2449 is more complex than simply via HSL mechanisms.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene did not appear to have an overall negative effect on quinolone biosynthesis.;  A more detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of individual PQS signaling molecules is required to gain an accurate picture on how the disruption of the PA2449 gene affects the PQS network in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The assimilation of glycine as a carbon source was dependent on the PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  In conclusion, the PA2449 gene was essential for the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on glycine as a sole carbon but not a nitrogen source.;  The elevated glycine concentrations generated in PW5126 cultures are indicative of a deficiency in glycine assimilation and are consistent with PA2449 being involved in glycine metabolism for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; PA2449 was observed to be essential for both pyocyanin biosynthesis and the utilization of glycine, and its deletion had a deleterious effect on the synthesis of C4-HSL.;  To elucidate how these processes are related through the PA2449 gene, we used microarrays to determine the transcriptome of PW5126.;  It was expected that the resulting transcriptomic data would provide key information on the involvement of PA2449 in both glycine assimilation and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; As established earlier, disruption of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL in PB.;  The microarray data also provided some insight into how the disruption of PA2449 may exert its influence on C4-HSL biosynthesis.; Selected list of genes having >2-fold changes in transcript levels in a transposon insertion PA2449 mutant (PW5126) compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in PB; In sharp contrast to the overabundance of genes regulated by C4-HSL signaling identified in the microarray experiments, only a limited number of genes represent potential candidates of PA2449 regulation and are restricted to those involved in glycine metabolism (Fig. 6).;  On the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, the PA2449 gene is localized near a gene cluster that encodes proteins involved in glycine and serine metabolism: gcvT2 (PA2442), sdaA (PA2443), glyA2 (PA2444), gcvP2 (PA2445), and gcvH2 (PA2446).;  These data and the previous observation that PA2449 was essential for glycine utilization support a probable role for PA2449 in regulating glycine metabolism in P. aeruginosa PAO1, possibly through facilitating the transcriptional activation of the gcvT2, sdaA, glyA2, gcvP2, and gcvH2 genes.; Key pathways of glycine assimilation that might be regulated by PA2449 in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Several genes whose products are predicted to be involved in glycine/serine metabolism were observed to be transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of a functional PA2449 gene.;  A follow-up lacZ reporter assay of the hcnA promoter confirmed that its activation was PA2449 dependent (Fig. 7B).;  PA2449 might provide another layer of regulation, which mediates the expression of hcnABC in the presence of excess intracellular glycine in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Examination of the metE-lacZ reporter revealed it to be activated only in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 7C); there was a >90% decrease in expression from the metE promoter in the absence of PA2449.;  It is probable that PA2449 positively regulates the expression of metE to increase metabolic flux from glycine to methionine.;  These findings indicate that the decreased expression of metE observed from PW5126 is due to elevated intracellular concentrations of glycine/serine, which could not be sufficiently metabolized in the absence of PA2449.;  Coordinating the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus with the activation of genes whose products function in SAM biosynthesis, e.g., metE and gcvT2H2P2, via PA2449 could mutually enhance pyocyanin biosynthesis.;  Whether PA2449 functions in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the production of C4-HSL and pyocyanin requires further exploration.; Serine dehydratase (encoded by sdaA) is necessary for the optimal growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in PB. (A) Pyocyanin production from P. aeruginosa mutants possessing transposon insertions within genes that are potential candidates of regulation by PA2449.; Proposed models for PA2449 in regulating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL and pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Transcription of mexEF-oprN, encoding an efflux pump, is repressed by PA2449.;  This prevents the efflux of intracellular PQS, thus enhancing the expression of rhl-related genes and phenotypes, including phenazine production. (B) The PA2449 protein directly activates the transcription of the C4-HSL synthase gene, rhlI, thereby facilitating the expression of the rhl network. (C) PA2449 operates independently of the rhl network to activate the expression of phz-related genes for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; The PA2449 gene, which encodes a putative TyrR-like transcriptional regulator, was essential for P. aeruginosa PAO1 to assimilate glycine as a carbon source.;  Disruption of the PA2449 gene also reduced the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on both serine and valine when either one was supplied as a carbon source.;  In contrast, the necessity of the PA2449 gene for optimal growth on valine cannot be readily explained and remains unclear.;  The PA2449 gene was not required for the utilization of any amino acid, including glycine and serine, as a source of nitrogen.;  This suggests that a possible function of PA2449 is to aid in the metabolism of glycine as a carbon but not nitrogen source for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; Microarray analysis revealed that the disruption of the PA2449 gene affected the transcription of genes encoding proteins of a glycine cleavage system (GcvT2, GcvH2, and GcvP2), a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA2), and a serine dehydratase (SdaA).;  Dysregulation of the glyA2 and sdaA genes would limit the metabolic flux of serine into glycine or pyruvate, respectively. glyA2 and sdaA dysregulation could account for the reduced growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on serine (as a carbon source) in the absence of PA2449.; Whether the PA2449 protein functions as a direct transcriptional activator for any of the genes located within the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus remains to be answered.;  However, the only genes related to glycine metabolism that were transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of PA2449 were gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 and glyA1.;  For example, the transcription of other choline-related catabolic genes (63), including sdaB and soxBDAG, was unaffected by the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Lastly, the transcription of genes whose products could participate in glycine metabolism, e.g., glyA3 and gcvP1H1T1 (PA5213 to PA5215), was unaffected by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene.; PA2449 may provide another tier of transcriptional regulation of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus.;  For example, PA2449 might upregulate the transcription of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus to ensure that the resulting GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA pathway has sufficient activity to meet the cellular demands associated with having to assimilate glycine as the only available carbon source.;  The PA2449 gene is conserved among pseudomonads, in which it lies in proximity to genes encoding a serine dehydratase and/or glycine cleavage system.;  The regulation of glycine and possibly serine catabolism by PA2449 might therefore be a universal phenomenon among Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was completely dependent on the PA2449 gene regardless of environmental conditions.;  Under a variety of different growth conditions and medium formulations, the PA2449 gene was essential for the production of pyocyanin.;  Specifically, the PA2449 gene was required for the transcriptional activation of genes, i.e., phzA1, phzA2, and phzM, necessary for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.;  Without the PA2449 gene, the basal level of transcription of the phz genes was sufficient for allowing the production of PCA at trace quantities.;  We later found that the cause for the decreased transcription of the phz genes in the absence of PA2449 was insufficient levels of C4-HSL (discussed below), which is involved in phz gene activation.; This study characterized the relationship between the PA2449 gene and the production of pyocyanin under nutritionally poor growth conditions, i.e., glycine was the predominant source of carbon, phosphate was in limiting concentrations, and both aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids were in scarce supply.;  Because glycine (serine) is a biosynthetic precursor to thiols/purines and a product of protein turnover, a reduction in these processes could cause a gradual increase in intracellular glycine (serine) concentrations that is eventually countered by PA2449.;  Metabolomic analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at the onset of pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation is required to validate the existence of such a scenario involving PA2449-directed glycine metabolism.; The inactivation of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL from P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  These findings indicate that the pyocyanin-null phenotype associated with the disruption of the PA2449 gene is a result of low or insufficient levels of C4-HSL, which consequently prevent RhlR from transcriptionally activating the phz genes required for pyocyanin biosynthesis.; Although we established that the production of C4-HSL requires a functional PA2449 gene, the reasoning or mechanism(s) underlying their relationship has not yet been determined.;  The data presented herein show that PA2449 is necessary for the catabolism of glycine as a carbon source, but QS also has also been shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in glycine metabolism (65).;  It is possible that glycine metabolism might be transcriptionally regulated only through QS in which PA2449 acts as an intermediary for facilitating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL in response to glycine availability.;  However, ΔrhlR, ΔlasR, and ΔrhlR ΔlasR P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants readily grew on minimal media with glycine as the sole carbon source; a trait not shared by the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  This suggests that glycine metabolism is dependent on PA2449 through mechanisms apart from QS in P. aeruginosa PAO1.; The necessity of the PA2449 gene, and possibly glycine metabolism, for the biosynthesis of C4-HSL is an intriguing question.;  In support of this mode of inhibition, we did observe that the transcription of the methionine synthase gene, metE, was repressed either by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene or through the exogenous addition of glycine/serine to P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures.;  However, the addition of methionine or heterologous expression of the E. coli metE gene in the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant did not restore C4-HSL to levels sufficient for triggering the production of pyocyanin.; The reduced production of C4-HSL in the absence of the PA2449 gene could be attributed to the decreased transcription (>3-fold) of the C4-HSL synthase gene rhlI.;  The role of PA2449 in the transcription of rhlI was narrowed down to a few possible factors (Fig. 9).;  First, we observed elevated transcription (>50-fold) of the pump-encoding mexEF-oprN genes with the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Therefore, PA2449 might function in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the accumulation of intracellular PQS for activation of the rhl network and subsequent C4-HSL biosynthesis (Fig. 9A).;  If indeed this is the mode of regulation by PA2449 of rhlI expression, it is expected that deletion of the mexEF-oprN locus in the PA2449 mutant (PW5126) will restore intracellular PQS to levels sufficient for mediating C4-HSL biosynthesis.;  Closer inspection of a ΔPA2449 ΔmexEF-oprN P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant for these physiological traits is an objective of future studies.; How PA2449 affects transcription of mexEF-oprN is unclear.;  Perhaps the PA2449 protein functions as this “unknown” repressor protein to facilitate the biosynthesis of C4-HSL under nutrient-poor conditions.;  In addition, the transcription of mexS (PA2493) genes was upregulated by 12-fold in the absence of PA2449.;  An additional regulator, MvaT (PA4315), which affects the expression of several QS-related genes such as mexEF-oprN (68), was not observed to be differentially transcribed between wild-type cells and the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  The mechanism by which PA2449 regulates the mexEF-oprN locus is currently being investigated.; In addition to influencing the transcription of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump genes, the PA2449 protein might serve as a direct transcriptional activator for the rhlI gene (Fig. 9B).;  The PA2449 protein is predicted to be an EBP, so it is plausible that it interacts with RpoN to mediate expression of the rhlI locus.;  Further in-depth studies will clarify the role of PA2449 in the production C4-HSL for P. aeruginosa PAO1.;

 On the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, the PA2449 gene is localized near a gene cluster that encodes proteins involved in glycine and serine metabolism: gcvT2 (PA2442), sdaA (PA2443), glyA2 (PA2444), gcvP2 (PA2445), and gcvH2 (PA2446).;  These data and the previous observation that PA2449 was essential for glycine utilization support a probable role for PA2449 in regulating glycine metabolism in P. aeruginosa PAO1, possibly through facilitating the transcriptional activation of the gcvT2, sdaA, glyA2, gcvP2, and gcvH2 genes.; Key pathways of glycine assimilation that might be regulated by PA2449 in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Several genes whose products are predicted to be involved in glycine/serine metabolism were observed to be transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of a functional PA2449 gene.;  A follow-up lacZ reporter assay of the hcnA promoter confirmed that its activation was PA2449 dependent (Fig. 7B).;  PA2449 might provide another layer of regulation, which mediates the expression of hcnABC in the presence of excess intracellular glycine in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Examination of the metE-lacZ reporter revealed it to be activated only in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 7C); there was a >90% decrease in expression from the metE promoter in the absence of PA2449.;  It is probable that PA2449 positively regulates the expression of metE to increase metabolic flux from glycine to methionine.;  These findings indicate that the decreased expression of metE observed from PW5126 is due to elevated intracellular concentrations of glycine/serine, which could not be sufficiently metabolized in the absence of PA2449.;  Coordinating the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus with the activation of genes whose products function in SAM biosynthesis, e.g., metE and gcvT2H2P2, via PA2449 could mutually enhance pyocyanin biosynthesis.;  Whether PA2449 functions in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the production of C4-HSL and pyocyanin requires further exploration.; Serine dehydratase (encoded by sdaA) is necessary for the optimal growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in PB. (A) Pyocyanin production from P. aeruginosa mutants possessing transposon insertions within genes that are potential candidates of regulation by PA2449.; Proposed models for PA2449 in regulating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL and pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Transcription of mexEF-oprN, encoding an efflux pump, is repressed by PA2449.;  This prevents the efflux of intracellular PQS, thus enhancing the expression of rhl-related genes and phenotypes, including phenazine production. (B) The PA2449 protein directly activates the transcription of the C4-HSL synthase gene, rhlI, thereby facilitating the expression of the rhl network. (C) PA2449 operates independently of the rhl network to activate the expression of phz-related genes for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; The PA2449 gene, which encodes a putative TyrR-like transcriptional regulator, was essential for P. aeruginosa PAO1 to assimilate glycine as a carbon source.;  Disruption of the PA2449 gene also reduced the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on both serine and valine when either one was supplied as a carbon source.;  In contrast, the necessity of the PA2449 gene for optimal growth on valine cannot be readily explained and remains unclear.;  The PA2449 gene was not required for the utilization of any amino acid, including glycine and serine, as a source of nitrogen.;  This suggests that a possible function of PA2449 is to aid in the metabolism of glycine as a carbon but not nitrogen source for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; Microarray analysis revealed that the disruption of the PA2449 gene affected the transcription of genes encoding proteins of a glycine cleavage system (GcvT2, GcvH2, and GcvP2), a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA2), and a serine dehydratase (SdaA).;  Dysregulation of the glyA2 and sdaA genes would limit the metabolic flux of serine into glycine or pyruvate, respectively. glyA2 and sdaA dysregulation could account for the reduced growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on serine (as a carbon source) in the absence of PA2449.; Whether the PA2449 protein functions as a direct transcriptional activator for any of the genes located within the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus remains to be answered.;  However, the only genes related to glycine metabolism that were transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of PA2449 were gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 and glyA1.;  For example, the transcription of other choline-related catabolic genes (63), including sdaB and soxBDAG, was unaffected by the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Lastly, the transcription of genes whose products could participate in glycine metabolism, e.g., glyA3 and gcvP1H1T1 (PA5213 to PA5215), was unaffected by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene.; PA2449 may provide another tier of transcriptional regulation of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus.;  For example, PA2449 might upregulate the transcription of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus to ensure that the resulting GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA pathway has sufficient activity to meet the cellular demands associated with having to assimilate glycine as the only available carbon source.;  The PA2449 gene is conserved among pseudomonads, in which it lies in proximity to genes encoding a serine dehydratase and/or glycine cleavage system.;  The regulation of glycine and possibly serine catabolism by PA2449 might therefore be a universal phenomenon among Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was completely dependent on the PA2449 gene regardless of environmental conditions.;  Under a variety of different growth conditions and medium formulations, the PA2449 gene was essential for the production of pyocyanin.;  Specifically, the PA2449 gene was required for the transcriptional activation of genes, i.e., phzA1, phzA2, and phzM, necessary for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.;  Without the PA2449 gene, the basal level of transcription of the phz genes was sufficient for allowing the production of PCA at trace quantities.;  We later found that the cause for the decreased transcription of the phz genes in the absence of PA2449 was insufficient levels of C4-HSL (discussed below), which is involved in phz gene activation.; This study characterized the relationship between the PA2449 gene and the production of pyocyanin under nutritionally poor growth conditions, i.e., glycine was the predominant source of carbon, phosphate was in limiting concentrations, and both aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids were in scarce supply.;  Because glycine (serine) is a biosynthetic precursor to thiols/purines and a product of protein turnover, a reduction in these processes could cause a gradual increase in intracellular glycine (serine) concentrations that is eventually countered by PA2449.;  Metabolomic analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at the onset of pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation is required to validate the existence of such a scenario involving PA2449-directed glycine metabolism.; The inactivation of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL from P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  These findings indicate that the pyocyanin-null phenotype associated with the disruption of the PA2449 gene is a result of low or insufficient levels of C4-HSL, which consequently prevent RhlR from transcriptionally activating the phz genes required for pyocyanin biosynthesis.; Although we established that the production of C4-HSL requires a functional PA2449 gene, the reasoning or mechanism(s) underlying their relationship has not yet been determined.;  The data presented herein show that PA2449 is necessary for the catabolism of glycine as a carbon source, but QS also has also been shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in glycine metabolism (65).;  It is possible that glycine metabolism might be transcriptionally regulated only through QS in which PA2449 acts as an intermediary for facilitating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL in response to glycine availability.;  However, ΔrhlR, ΔlasR, and ΔrhlR ΔlasR P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants readily grew on minimal media with glycine as the sole carbon source; a trait not shared by the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  This suggests that glycine metabolism is dependent on PA2449 through mechanisms apart from QS in P. aeruginosa PAO1.; The necessity of the PA2449 gene, and possibly glycine metabolism, for the biosynthesis of C4-HSL is an intriguing question.;  In support of this mode of inhibition, we did observe that the transcription of the methionine synthase gene, metE, was repressed either by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene or through the exogenous addition of glycine/serine to P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures.;  However, the addition of methionine or heterologous expression of the E. coli metE gene in the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant did not restore C4-HSL to levels sufficient for triggering the production of pyocyanin.; The reduced production of C4-HSL in the absence of the PA2449 gene could be attributed to the decreased transcription (>3-fold) of the C4-HSL synthase gene rhlI.;  The role of PA2449 in the transcription of rhlI was narrowed down to a few possible factors (Fig. 9).;  First, we observed elevated transcription (>50-fold) of the pump-encoding mexEF-oprN genes with the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Therefore, PA2449 might function in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the accumulation of intracellular PQS for activation of the rhl network and subsequent C4-HSL biosynthesis (Fig. 9A).;  If indeed this is the mode of regulation by PA2449 of rhlI expression, it is expected that deletion of the mexEF-oprN locus in the PA2449 mutant (PW5126) will restore intracellular PQS to levels sufficient for mediating C4-HSL biosynthesis.;  Closer inspection of a ΔPA2449 ΔmexEF-oprN P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant for these physiological traits is an objective of future studies.; How PA2449 affects transcription of mexEF-oprN is unclear.;  Perhaps the PA2449 protein functions as this “unknown” repressor protein to facilitate the biosynthesis of C4-HSL under nutrient-poor conditions.;  In addition, the transcription of mexS (PA2493) genes was upregulated by 12-fold in the absence of PA2449.;  An additional regulator, MvaT (PA4315), which affects the expression of several QS-related genes such as mexEF-oprN (68), was not observed to be differentially transcribed between wild-type cells and the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  The mechanism by which PA2449 regulates the mexEF-oprN locus is currently being investigated.; In addition to influencing the transcription of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump genes, the PA2449 protein might serve as a direct transcriptional activator for the rhlI gene (Fig. 9B).;  The PA2449 protein is predicted to be an EBP, so it is plausible that it interacts with RpoN to mediate expression of the rhlI locus.;  Further in-depth studies will clarify the role of PA2449 in the production C4-HSL for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; This study characterizes the physiological and genetic effects of a transposon deletion PA2449 mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The PA2449 gene is predicted to encode either a TyrR or EBP type transcriptional regulator.;  This ambiguity is due to the fact that the PA2449 protein possess homology to both the TyrR protein of E. coli and the EBP PhhR of P. aeruginosa.;  However, an alignment between these three proteins shows that the primary sequence of the PA2449 protein is 44% identical to that of PhhR and 41% identical to that of E. coli TyrR.;  Additionally, there is a stretch of ∼8 amino acid residues unique to only the PA2449 protein and PhhR.;  Several of the genes that are potentially regulated by the PA2449 protein, including gcvH2, phzB1, and rhlI, possess putative RpoN promoters (http://www.sigma54.ca/promoterdata/Web/data.aspx).;  These data support a probable role for the PA2449 protein as an EBP that interacts with RpoN to mediate transcription under conditions in which glycine is the predominant carbon source.; To biochemically characterize and verify that the PA2449 protein behaves as an EBP, it is imperative to determine the intracellular signal(s) sensed by this protein.;  Our data clearly show that PA2449 is involved in glycine metabolism, so an obvious candidate for triggering the PA2449 protein into an active state is glycine or possibly its metabolic counterpart serine.;  The PA2449 protein may interact with a specific THF derivative, thus activating expression of GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA and subsequently restoring balance to the THF pool.;  PA2449 was involved in C4-HSL biosynthesis by possibly augmenting the PQS response.;  Does the PA2449 protein respond to PQS? We are currently examining the biochemical function of the PA2449 protein and attempting to define its in vivo targets in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown under glycine-rich, pyocyanin-producing conditions.",PA2449,toxicity,,up

28931063,5607194," However, flavones exhibited synergy against P. aeruginosa in the presence of antibiotics or recombinant human lysozyme.; Because many innate defense proteins secreted by the airway epithelium act in part through bacterial lysis or permeabilization (e.g. lysozyme [62–67] and β-defensins [68–71]), we sought to test whether flavones may enhance the efficacy of airway antimicrobials.;  We tested the effects of flavones combined with the important airway antimicrobial lysozyme, which is secreted by airway submucosal gland serous cells [72–74] and catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall [75, 76]. We focused on P. aeruginosa, as it appeared to be the most sensitive to flavone effects among the pathogens tested here.;  While lysozyme is more effective against gram-positive bacteria, it does have effects against gram-negative bacteria.;  In the presence of EDTA to help disrupt the outer lipopolysaccharide-containing gram-negative layer, rapid lysis is observed with lysozyme treatment at low ionic strength [76, 77]. Rapid lysis of P. aeruginosa (decrease in OD600) was observed in the presence of recombinant human lysozyme ± flavones (Fig 3A–3C).;  While individual flavones (apigenin, chrysin, and wogonin) caused minimal lysis under these conditions and did not enhance lysozyme-mediated lysis, a mixture of these flavones (100 μM each) promoted lysis approximately 50% as well as lysozyme after 2 hrs. (Fig 3C).;  Moreover, the flavone mixture significantly enhanced lysozyme-mediated P. aeruginosa lysis (Fig 3B and 3C).; (A) Traces of planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of flavones ± lysozyme.;  Note the greatest OD600 decrease (bacterial lysis) occurred with lysozyme and flavone mix combined. (B) Bar graphs of the initial OD decrease rate (OD600 units/min) from A (n = 3–6 experiments for each condition). (C) Bar graphs showing ΔOD600 after 2 hours from A.;  After exposure to lysozyme ± flavones for 10 min, cells were centrifuged and supernatant was collected for measurement of fluorescence.;  Neither 300 μM apigenin nor 300 μM chrysin significantly increased lysozyme-mediated lysis (Fig 4), supporting that there is a synergistic effect of mixing flavone compounds.; Bar graph showing normalized fluorescence (control = 1) from PAO-GFP cultures incubated in lysozyme lysis buffer with addition of lysozyme and/or flavones as indicated and described in the text.;  Synergistic effects of the flavone mixture were observed both alone and combined with lysozyme.;  NPN is a hydrophobic fluorophore that undergoes a quantum yield increase upon transition from a hydrophilic aqueous environment to a hydrophobic phospholipid environment [78], and NPN uptake is frequently used to measure gram-negative outer membrane permeabilization [78–82]. A flavone mix enhanced NPN uptake alone or in combination with lysozyme greater than an equal amount of individual flavones, as found above (Fig 5).; Bacteria were incubated for 5 min with lysozyme ± flavones as indicated and described in the text, followed by measurement of NPN fluorescence, reflecting uptake of NPN into the bacterial phospholipid membrane.; To determine if the effects observed above with recombinant lysozyme translated to enhancement of physiological antimicrobials secreted by airway epithelial cells, we tested the ability of flavones to enhance the antimicrobial activity of Calu-3 cell secretions.;  Calu-3 cells are a model of airway secretory cells [72], resembling some aspects of both submucosal gland serous cells (e.g. secretion of lysozyme [83] and β-defensins [84]) as well as surface epithelial goblet cells (e.g. secretion of Muc5AC [85, 86]).; Here, we found specifically that a mixture of flavones can enhance the bacteriolytic activity of recombinant human lysozyme against a common gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa, and flavones can enhance the bactericidal activity of endogenous human respiratory cell secretions, of which lysozyme is a major component [65, 83, 89, 90]. Together with our previous study [32], our data suggest flavone compounds might modulate respiratory innate immunity through multiple mechanisms (Fig 7).;  Lysozyme lysis assays were conducted essentially as described [76, 77, 96]. Bacteria were washed and resuspended (OD 0.5) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 with recombinant human lysozyme ± flavones before monitoring OD600 between incubations at 37°C.;  For GFP release assays, lysozyme lysis experiments were carried out as above in 1 mL volume; after 10 min, samples were centrifuged to pellet bacteria (10,000 g for 15 min) and supernatant GFP fluorescence was measured on a Tecan Spark 10M plate reader (485 excitation, 535 emission).;  Background was estimated by measuring lysis buffer alone and was subtracted from each experimental value before normalization to control conditions (supernatant from cells in lysis buffer alone, no lysozyme).",lysozyme,respiratory infections,,up

20008172,2813009," Genome analyses and comparisons of phylogenies inferred from sequences of the key phenazine biosynthesis (phzF) and housekeeping (rrs, recA, rpoB, atpD, and gyrB) genes revealed that the evolution and dispersal of phenazine genes are driven by mechanisms ranging from conservation in Pseudomonas spp. to horizontal gene transfer in Burkholderia spp. and Pectobacterium spp.;  A single lower primer, recArps, was used in combination with upper primers recAf1, recAfcep, and recAfcoli to amplify recA in Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Pectobacterium, respectively.;  The homologous gene in Brevibacterium iodinum and S. cinnamonensis was targeted with primers recAfbr and recArbr (Table ​(Table2).2).;  ML phylogenies were estimated independently for each data set (phzF, rrs, atpD, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) and for the combined housekeeping gene data set (rrs, atpD, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) by using heuristic searches in PAUP.;  To assess the suitability of combining the rrs, atpD, gyrB, recA, and rpoB data sets for phylogenetic analysis, a “conditional data combination” approach (27) was employed.; Sequence data have been deposited in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652597"",""term_id"":""254055121"",""term_text"":""FJ652597""}}FJ652597 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652623"",""term_id"":""254055147"",""term_text"":""FJ652623""}}FJ652623 for rrs; {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652624"",""term_id"":""254055202"",""term_text"":""FJ652624""}}FJ652624 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652650"",""term_id"":""254055254"",""term_text"":""FJ652650""}}FJ652650 for recA; {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652651"",""term_id"":""254055420"",""term_text"":""FJ652651""}}FJ652651 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652677"",""term_id"":""254055472"",""term_text"":""FJ652677""}}FJ652677 for atpD; {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652678"",""term_id"":""254055148"",""term_text"":""FJ652678""}}FJ652678 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652704"",""term_id"":""254055200"",""term_text"":""FJ652704""}}FJ652704 for rpoB; {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652705"",""term_id"":""254055366"",""term_text"":""FJ652705""}}FJ652705 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652731"",""term_id"":""254055418"",""term_text"":""FJ652731""}}FJ652731 for gyrB; and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652732"",""term_id"":""254055256"",""term_text"":""FJ652732""}}FJ652732 through {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ652786"",""term_id"":""254055364"",""term_text"":""FJ652786""}}FJ652786 for phzF.;  These species are closely related and are commonly identified based on recA sequence and multilocus sequence typing analyses. recA-based dissection of clade A revealed that the newly sequenced strains 5.5B and 2424 (together with very similar strains PC4, PC8, PC17, PC22, PC28, and PC39) are closely related to Burkholderia pyrrocinia and B. cepacia, respectively (Fig. ​(Fig.2B),2B), whereas strain 383, which was recently separated and placed in a new species called B. lata (65), is similar to Burkholderia contaminans and Burkholderia ambifaria.; Neighbor-joining phylogenies inferred from data for rrs sequences of Burkholderia spp. (A) and recA genes of the B. cepacia species complex (B).;  Indels were ignored, and the data sets used for analysis of rrs and recA contained 1,307 and 561 characters, respectively.; Comparison of neighbor-joining phylogenies inferred from data for phzF (A) and concatenated housekeeping genes (rrs, recA, rpoB, atpD, and gyrB) (B) of the core set of phenazine-producing species.; To compare the phylogeny of phzF to that of the core bacterial genome, we estimated phylogeny using five highly conserved housekeeping genes: rrs, recA, rpoB, atpD, and gyrB.",recA,fitness,,up
21342469,3818864," Here we show the results of a genome‐wide transcriptome analysis of a scbA deletion mutant prior to and during the transition to antibiotic production.;  Also, ScbR binds the promoter of scbA (site A); however, with an opposite effect: its presence is necessary for scbA induction (Takano et al., 2001). scbA is divergent from scbR, and its deletion impairs production of SCBs, and causes an earlier and enhanced Red and Act production (Takano et al., 2001). scbA and scbR expression is absent in the S. coelicolor scbA deletion mutant M751; addition of SCB1 restores scbR transcription, but not that of scbA.;  To analyse the role of ScbA and the butanolide system more extensively, gene expression in a scbA deletion mutant (M751), just before and during the onset of antibiotic production, was compared with the wild‐type M145 using whole‐genome microarrays and quantitative RT‐PCR (qRT‐PCR) analyses.; Antibiotic production in the scbA deletion mutant (M751) occurs earlier and leads to a 10‐fold higher final yield of both Act and Red than that of the wild‐type (M145) strain (Takano et al., 2001).; Growth curves of the wild‐type and the ΔscbA mutant.;  Cell growth in liquid SMM medium of the wild type (dark line, diamond) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line, square) was monitored in time, measuring the absorbance of the culture at OD450.;  Undecylprodigiosin production started at the beginning of the transition phase in the wild type (red bar) and at mid‐exponential phase in the ΔscbA mutant (red bar).; Identification of perturbed genes in the ΔscbA mutant using principal component analysis (PCA).A.;  Microarray analysis of global transcription profile of the wild type (left panel) and the ΔscbA mutant (right panel), sorted by hierarchical clustering.;  The gene expression values in wild type (green line) and the ΔscbA mutant (red line) were analysed by PCA, and the values of principal component 1 are plotted versus principal component 2.;  The two main patterns of the difference expression profile between the wild type and the ΔscbA mutant are shown, based on the loadings of PC‐1 (dark line) and PC‐2 (light line) in PCA of the expression difference profiles.;  In addition to undecylprodigiosin, scbA mutant M751 overproduced the blue‐pigmented actinorhodin, also consistent with an earlier report (Takano et al., 2001).; Expression profiles of secondary metabolism genes in the wild type and the ΔscbA mutant.;  The average expression profiles of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters red (SCO5877–5898), act (SCO5071–5091), cpk (SCO6268–6288) and des (SCO2782–2785) during the time‐course are plotted for the wild type (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  Expression profiles of genes of the red cluster [redD (SCO5877) and redQ (SCO5887)] (A), the act cluster [actII‐orf4 (SCO5085) and actIII (SCO5086)] (B), the cpk cluster [cpkE (SCO6277), cpkO (SCO6280) and scbR2 (SCO6286)] (C) are plotted for the wild type (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).; Most dramatically, the cpk cluster (SCO6268–6288) was silenced in M751 throughout the entire growth curve (Fig. 3), while in the wild type it showed a sharp overexpression from TP4 onwards, coinciding with the expression peak of scbA and scbR (Fig. S1).; Expression profiles of primary metabolism genes in M145 and the ΔscbA mutant.;  The average of genes involved in conversion of pyruvate to acetyl‐CoA (ace) and from acetyl‐CoA to malonyl‐CoA (ACCase complex) and the average expression profiles of the primary metabolism genes for the PPP and glycolysis pathways during the time‐course are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The average expression profiles of a set of morphological differentiation genes and the conservon 9 [cvn9 (rar)] are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The fold change between the ΔscbA mutant and M145 of expression profiles of 11 genes (indicated at the side) overlapping putative ncRNAs are plotted.;  These data agree with the reported abolished expression of cpkO, the pathway‐specific activator of the cpk cluster in the scbA mutant (Takano et al., 2005).; Another secondary metabolite cluster drastically affected by deleting scbA was the siderophore desferrioxamine E biosynthesis.;  These findings agree with the earlier production of antibiotics, suggesting that the deletion of scbA causes a shift of the primary metabolism pathways, which is required for Act and Red production.;  Earlier production of aerial hyphae or spores have not been reported in the scbA mutant (Takano et al., 2001), and we also did not observe any difference in development on solid media between the wild type and the mutant.;  Strengthening this hypothesis, the differential expression profile, between the wild type and the scbA mutant, of SCO4189 and devA is anticorrelated (data not shown).;  Expression profiles of scbA (SCO6266) (values from qRT‐PCR analysis), scbR (SCO6265) (values from qRT‐PCR analysis) and scbC (SCO6267) (values from microarray analysis) are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The expression fold change for scbA and scbR is compared with the value in M145 at TP1, which is set as 1.;  Standard deviation for scbA and scbR qRT‐PCR analysis at each time point is denoted in a thin light line.",scbA,pigmented,,

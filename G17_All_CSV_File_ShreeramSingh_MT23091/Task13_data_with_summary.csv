ABC,10058,27903896,5210574," In order to advance the exploration of microbial secondary metabolism, we developed the largest publically available database of experimentally verified and predicted BCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc/).;  Here, we describe an update of IMG-ABC, which includes ClusterScout, a tool for targeted identification of custom biosynthetic gene clusters across 40 000 isolate microbial genomes, and a new search capability to query more than 700 000 BCs from isolate genomes for clusters with similar Pfam composition.;  These new tools and features add to the value of IMG-ABC's vast body of BC data, facilitating their in-depth analysis and accelerating secondary metabolite discovery.; In order to facilitate the discovery and analysis of BCs and SMs in bacterial genomes and metagenomes, a data mart called the Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters within the Integrated Microbial Genomes system (11) (IMG-ABC) was introduced in 2015 (12).;  The result of this integration was the growth of the IMG-ABC database to contain more than 730 000 BCs in 40 034 isolate microbial genomes and >310 000 BCs in 2416 metagenomes.;  IMG-ABC also provided the means to search these large datasets based on BC and SM attributes, such as BC type, Pfam (14) and EC content (15), BC length, SM activity etc.;  Here, we present an update of IMG-ABC, which includes several new features improving data mining and navigation, such as a set of tools for BC visualization and comparison, and targeted BC identification across thousands of isolate bacterial genomes with ClusterScout.; IMG-ABC can be accessed at https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc/ and can be browsed without a login requirement.;  However, creating a free IMG account enables users to utilize IMG-ABC's ‘BC Set’ feature, which allows saving groups of BCs on the server side for future retrieval and sharing.; In the initial version of IMG-ABC, users could search the BC database using various attributes, such as BC type, SM produced, or the presence of specific Pfams (14).;  Briefly, in order to find BCs with similar Pfam composition, Pfams assigned to the genes of the query BC are collected and searched against the IMG-ABC database for BCs containing at least three of these Pfams.;  In order to minimize the running time of the search, the ubiquitous ABC Transporter family (PF00005) is not considered at this step.;  Similar functionality in IMG-ABC is provided by ClusterScout, a tool that uses gene Pfam content for the identification of BCs across all publicly available isolate bacterial genomes in IMG.;  The results of a ClusterScout search are saved for up to 24 hours on the IMG-ABC server, so users are encouraged to download the results or, using a registered account, save them in a BC Set.; IMG-ABC case study.

(B) The function heatmap visualization can be used to study the Pfam content of BCs.;  The green node represents experimentally verified BC for DAPG (from a gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens) in the IMG-ABC database.; The new version of IMG-ABC includes the BC cart, a feature familiar to IMG users (11), which serves to collect the BCs of interest for further in-depth analysis (Figure ​(Figure3A).3A).;  With this update of IMG-ABC, we are introducing the ability to visualize BC similarity networks (Figure ​(Figure3C)3C) by performing all-versus-all pairwise comparisons of selected BCs to create a similarity matrix.; To showcase the power of the new IMG-ABC features applied to a large database of annotated genomes we present a BC discovery and characterization case study using an example of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) biosynthesis, which is annotated by the current version of antiSMASH (13) as type 3 polyketide synthase cluster without SM product prediction.;  This search and subsequent analysis using IMG-ABC tools took less than an hour, and has led to the identification of putative DAPG biosynthesis clusters in four betaproteobacteria: a bacterium identified as Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans EGD-HP2 (19) and three members of Chromobacterium genus, Chromobacterium vaccinii MWU205 (20), C. vaccinii MWU328 (20) and Chromobacterium piscinae ND17 (21).;  This example demonstrates the power of IMG-ABC data and tools in supporting the analysis of genome sequences, enabling biological interpretation of sequence data and formulation of testable hypotheses.;  IMG-ABC contains the largest publicly available collection of experimentally identified and predicted BCs.;  Lastly, the content of the IMG-ABC database will be updated to include BC predictions from the latest version of antiSMASH, which not only includes more BC types in the identification algorithm, but also implements ClusterFinder to improve BC boundary prediction (13).;  IMG-ABC will continue to be provided to the users without the need for registration, making the exploration of global microbial secondary metabolism accessible to the entire scientific community.",

B17,4712,21429787,3947797," Today, this burgeoning class of natural products encompasses a structurally and functionally diverse set of molecules (i.e. microcin B17, cyanobactins, and thiopeptides).;  A few examples include thiostrepton (50S ribosome inhibitor) [2], trunkamide (anti-cancer compound) [3], microcin B17 (DNA gyrase inhibitor) [4], goadsporin (secondary metabolism inducer) [5], yersiniabactin (siderophore) [6], and Ritonavir (HIV-1 protease inhibitor) [7] (Figure 1b).;  As specifically mentioned in the main text: Microcin B17, the 10-glycine spacer is underlined and bolded, while the first bisheterocycle site is boxed; Thiostrepton, alanines 2 and 4 are highlighted in orange and brown, respectively.;  In the other cases, the cyclodehydratase is found as a separate open reading frame but is expected to form a complex with the docking protein, as demonstrated in microcin B17 biosynthesis [8•]. Beyond the heterocyclization machinery, TOMM clusters can also possess other posttranslational modification enzymes, a topic discussed later in this review.; The general biosynthetic route for the production of microcin B17 (Figure 1b), a TOMM from select strains of Escherichia coli, was first reported in 1996 [8•]. In this seminal paper, it was shown that a trimeric synthetase complex composed of McbB (cyclodehydratase), McbC (dehydrogenase), and McbD installed thiazole and oxazole moieties onto the McbA precursor peptide.;  This first enzymatic insight into the maturation of microcin B17 prompted numerous additional studies.;  There also appeared to be a distance dependence on microcin B17 heterocycle formation.;  Likewise, a two-fold increase in rate was observed when the linker was lengthened to 11-glycines (Figure 1b) [29]. The order of heterocycle formation was also determined for microcin B17 via tandem MS.;  Furthermore, McbBCD released the McbA substrate after each heterocycle was formed, making microcin B17 biosynthesis a distributive process [31]. From all of these biochemical studies, it was evident that the microcin B17 biosynthetic machinery displayed regiospecific activity.;  Moreover, this report proved that these metabolites were of ribosomal origin [34••]. Since this initial discovery, the biosynthetic gene clusters for many cyanobactins have been identified [17•,32,35,36], some of which appear to have been distributed through horizontal gene transfer [37]. Additional studies with patellamide and trunkamide determined that the heterocycles were installed in a manner similar to microcin B17, supporting the classification of the heterocycle-containing cyanobactins as TOMMs.;  One key difference is that, unlike microcin B17, the cyanobactin hypervariable core peptides are flanked by highly conserved motifs.;  A pioneering discovery in 1998 identified the first SLS-associated gene (sagA) and led to the discovery of the entire sag operon [43,44]. Further studies demonstrated that the biosynthetic gene cluster required for SLS production was composed of a dehydrogenase (SagB), a cyclodehydratase (SagC), and a docking protein (SagD), which act collectively to install thiazole and oxazole heterocycles onto an inactive precursor peptide (SagA) [42•]. After heterocycle installation by in vitro reconstitution, SagA was converted into a broadly active cytolysin, providing the first molecular level description of the factor responsible for the β-hemolytic phenotype of S. pyogenes [42•]. Given that the biosynthetic route to SLS was highly reminiscent of microcin B17, it was subsequently demonstrated that reacting McbA with SagBCD resulted in the formation of heterocycles on McbA, again highlighting the enzymatic promiscuity of the TOMM machinery [42•]. As with the early studies on SLS, the problematic amino acid composition of SagA thwarted numerous modern MS methods to identify sites of posttranslational modification after reaction with SagBCD."," The general biosynthetic route for the production of microcin B17

Crp,20468888,23232715,3520106,"Cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp) is a transcription regulator controlling diverse cellular processes in many bacteria.;  In Streptomyces coelicolor, it is well established that Crp plays a critical role in spore germination and colony development.;  Here, we demonstrate that Crp is a key regulator of secondary metabolism and antibiotic production in S. coelicolor and show that it may additionally coordinate precursor flux from primary to secondary metabolism.;  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray (ChIP-chip) assays, we determined that eight (out of 22) secondary metabolic clusters encoded by S. coelicolor contained Crp-associated sites.;  We followed the effect of Crp induction using transcription profiling analyses and found secondary metabolic genes to be significantly affected: included in this Crp-dependent group were genes from six of the clusters identified in the ChIP-chip experiments.;  Overexpressing Crp in a panel of Streptomyces species led to enhanced antibiotic synthesis and new metabolite production, suggesting that Crp control over secondary metabolism is broadly conserved in the streptomycetes and that Crp overexpression could serve as a powerful tool for unlocking the chemical potential of these organisms.;  Here, we show that Crp (the classical regulator of carbon catabolite repression in Escherichia coli) is a master regulator of secondary metabolism in Streptomyces.;  Deletion of crp in S. coelicolor leads to dramatic reductions in antibiotic levels, while Crp overexpression enhances antibiotic production.;  We find that the antibiotic-stimulatory capacity of Crp extends to other streptomycetes, where its overexpression activates the production of “cryptic” metabolites that are not otherwise seen in the corresponding wild-type strain.;  One broadly conserved regulator of bacterial metabolism is the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp).;  Crp is found throughout Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, although it is absent in Bacillus and the other Firmicutes (14).;  Crp has been best studied in Escherichia coli, where it mediates carbon catabolite repression in conjunction with its effector molecule cAMP (14, 15).;  In E. coli, Crp binds tightly to ~70 different genetic regions and affects the expression of hundreds of genes (16).;  In the actinomycetes, including Streptomyces, Crp also has important global regulatory roles, although it does not seem to function in carbon catabolite repression (17–19).; Previous work on Crp in S. coelicolor has confirmed its ability to interact with cAMP (20), while functional studies have primarily focused on its role in morphological development, as Δcrp mutants have very distinct developmental defects (reduced and delayed germination, small colonies, and accelerated sporulation) (19, 21).;  Here, we probe the function of Crp in controlling secondary metabolism and show that Crp contributes directly to the regulation of multiple antibiotics in S. coelicolor and stimulates secondary metabolism more broadly in the streptomycetes.;  Furthermore, we show that Crp directly affects the expression of enzymes needed for precursor synthesis, suggesting an ability to influence precursor flux into secondary metabolism and a role for Crp at the interface of primary and secondary metabolism.;  These data suggest that Crp has a global influence on secondary metabolite production.; Given the dramatic secondary metabolic defects exhibited by a Δcrp mutant, we wanted to determine the targets of Crp activity in the cell.;  As a first step, we monitored Crp transcript and protein levels over a 48-h time course in liquid culture (prior to the onset of significant actinorhodin production) to determine when Crp was expressed.;  In contrast, Crp protein levels were relatively constant throughout the same 48-h period (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).;  We next examined cAMP levels over the time when crp was most highly expressed (12 to 20 h), as cAMP is presumed to be the effector molecule for Crp, based on studies in other bacteria (22–24).;  We tested the effect of high levels of exogenous cAMP (2 mM) on the behavior of the wild-type strain and found there to be no obvious phenotypic difference between this strain and the one grown without supplementation (data not shown), suggesting that the phenotype of the crp mutant stems from loss of Crp and not from heightened cAMP production.; Consequently, we pursued investigations into Crp targets after growth for 16 h, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with purified Crp-specific polyclonal antibodies, together with microarray analyses of the precipitated DNA (ChIP-chip).;  We considered a sequence to be Crp associated if the log2(wild-type/mutant signal ratio) was greater than 3 times the standard deviation above the median ratio (>1.73) and if at least one adjacent probe sequence also met this criterion.;  We found 393 Crp-associated sequences, distributed relatively evenly throughout the genome (Fig. 2A).; Association of Crp with the S. coelicolor genome. (A) A map of the S. coelicolor genome with ChIP-chip and transcriptome profiling data.;  The characterized or predicted secondary metabolic clusters (28) are highlighted in green in the outermost circle; those clusters associated with Crp are written in purple.;  The genomic distribution of Crp association sites is shown in red in the innermost circle, while Crp targets identified in transcriptome profiling are indicated with black lines in the middle circles.;  The black lines pointing toward the outside represent genes upregulated by Crp induction, while those pointing toward the center indicate downregulated genes.;  The map was created using CGView software (59). (B) Validation of Crp association sites using ChIP assays together with qPCR, before and after crp induction in a Δcrp mutant carrying pIJ6902crp. (C) DNase I footprinting was conducted on three different targets, and a consensus binding site was identified in the protected regions (top panel).;  Analysis of a further 24 Crp target sequences (focusing on those involved in primary and secondary metabolism) revealed a degenerate version of this consensus sequence to be overrepresented in the probe-associated sequences (bottom panel).; Notably, eight out of the 22 predicted secondary metabolic clusters in S. coelicolor were associated with Crp binding sites (Fig. 2A; Table 1) (28).;  Of the characterized clusters, Crp coimmunoprecipitated with at least two sites in, or upstream of, the coding regions of pathway-specific regulatory genes for the Act (SCO5085; actII-ORF4), Red (SCO5881; redZ), and CDA (SCO3217; cdaR) biosynthetic gene clusters (Table 1).;  Multiple Crp binding sites were also associated with the biosynthetic genes for yCPK, specifically, upstream and within cpkA, which encodes a polyketide synthase (Table 1).;  The other four metabolic clusters associated with Crp binding are predicted to code for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (SCO6429-6438), the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone (SCO5222-5223), a type II fatty acid synthase (SCO1265-1273), and a deoxysugar synthase/glycosyltransferase (SCO0381-0401) (Table 1).;  Intriguingly, the Crp-associated sequences for each of these clusters correspond to positions upstream and/or within the first gene of each cluster.;  This suggests that there is potential for Crp to specifically regulate the expression of the entire cluster, possibly serving as a “pathway-specific regulator” for those clusters that lack one.; To begin to validate Crp association with select sequences, we constructed a thiostrepton-inducible crp construct and introduced this plasmid into the Δcrp mutant strain.;  As a negative control, a sequence from SCO4662 (tuf-1) was also subjected to qPCR amplification, as this sequence was not identified as a Crp binding target in our initial ChIP-chip analyses.;  All target sequences, apart from the negative control, were enriched in the immunoprecipitated DNA within 15 min and, more significantly, after 45 min of Crp induction (Fig. 2B).;  This experiment indirectly confirmed SCO5085 (actII-ORF4), SCO3217 (cdaR), and SCO5881 (redZ) as Crp targets.; Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using select Crp-associated sequences failed to yield traditional shifts, a phenomenon that has been noted in previous studies (19, 20) and may be due to the unusually low pI (5.8) of the Streptomyces Crp, relative to its counterpart in other bacteria.;  We therefore pursued DNase I footprinting assays on several of the Crp-associated sequences that gave an unusual “downshift” in our initial EMSA trials, in an effort to identify a consensus binding sequence (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).; Since both phenotypic investigations and ChIP-chip assays had suggested a role for Crp in secondary metabolite regulation, transcriptome profiling was conducted to gain further insight into the Crp control of these genes/clusters.;  We opted to follow Crp-dependent effects using an inducible system, where crp was expressed from a thiostrepton-inducible promoter, rather than simply comparing expression patterns of wild-type and mutant strains, as these strains grow very differently (the Δcrp mutant is significantly delayed in germination relative to the wild-type strain).;  Overall, we found the expression of 360 genes to be activated and that of 91 genes to be repressed following Crp induction (Fig. 2A; see Table S2 in the supplemental material).; Consistent with the ChIP-chip assay results, functional classification of the Crp-affected genes supported a central role for Crp in governing secondary metabolism, with nearly 20% of all differentially expressed genes encoding products involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).;  Notably, genes within the Act, Red, CDA, and yCPK clusters were significantly upregulated in response to Crp induction (Fig. 3).;  Expression of the NRPS gene cluster (SCO6429-38) that contained a Crp association sequence was activated as well, whereas the albaflavenone biosynthetic genes (SCO5222-23) were repressed (Table 2).;  The ChIP-chip targets are shaded in red for all six clusters (Crp binding sites for each are summarized in Table 1), upregulated genes are shaded in orange, and those shown in white did not show any significant change in response to Crp induction.; When comparing Crp-associated DNA targets from our ChIP-chip experiments with the differentially expressed genes identified in our microarray experiments, we found overlap not only of key secondary metabolic genes but also of genes encoding key primary metabolic enzymes that make important contributions to secondary metabolism.;  These results suggest that Crp activity plays a central role in promoting secondary metabolite production in S. coelicolor, integrating multiple regulatory nodes that include the direct control of antibiotic production via the pathway-specific regulators and the modulation of primary metabolic pathways feeding into secondary metabolism.; Crp is well conserved across the streptomycetes, with alignments revealing >90% amino acid sequence identity shared between different Crp orthologs (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).;  Given the importance of Crp to secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor, we tested whether Crp overexpression could enhance antibiotic production in this organism.;  The Crp overexpression construct, along with an empty-plasmid control, was then conjugated into S. coelicolor, and antibiotic production was analyzed.;  Significant upregulation of the blue-pigmented Act antibiotic was obvious in surface-grown cultures of the Crp-overexpressing strain (Fig. 1A), and this was further confirmed through quantitative assays of liquid medium-grown cultures (Fig. 1B).; To determine whether the antibiotic-stimulatory effects of Crp were more universal, we introduced the Crp overexpression construct into a number of different Streptomyces species, including both sequenced strains and wild Streptomyces isolates (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).;  Using immunoblotting, we confirmed that Crp was overexpressed in these strains, relative to controls bearing the empty-plasmid vector, and verified that similar total protein levels were being compared using Coomassie blue staining (see Fig. S5).;  Crp overexpression appeared to stimulate antibiotic production in the wild isolate Streptomyces sp. strain WAC4988, as determined by the enhanced zones of clearing observed for S. aureus and B. subtilis indicator strains (Fig. 4A).;  We also followed secondary metabolite production using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), to determine whether Crp overexpression induced any significant secondary metabolic changes in strains that did not show increased antimicrobial activity.;  These findings support a role for Crp as a global activator of secondary metabolism throughout the streptomycetes.; Effect of Crp overexpression on antibiotic production and secondary metabolism in diverse Streptomyces species. (A) Enhanced antibiotic production by Streptomyces sp. strain WAC4988 when overexpressing Crp.;  Bacillus subtilis was used as an indicator strain. (B) Base peak chromatograms and mass spectra of upregulated metabolite peaks following Crp overexpression in Streptomyces sp. strain SPB74.;  In the base peak chromatograms, the wild-type strain carrying the empty plasmid is shown in blue, while the Crp overexpression strain is indicated in red.; Crp is a founding member of the cAMP receptor protein (Crp)/fumarate-nitrate-reductase (FNR) family of regulators and predominantly functions as a transcriptional activator (14).;  In addition to regulating the catabolite repression pathway in E. coli, Crp also controls a much broader range of cellular functions, including primary metabolism, stress resistance, cell motility, and pathogenesis (31).;  In S. coelicolor, the function of Crp in spore germination and morphological development has been well documented (19–21).;  Here, we extend the role of Crp, revealing it to be a central regulator capable of coordinating primary and secondary metabolism and demonstrating that its activity can be coopted to enhance antibiotic production in diverse Streptomyces species.;  Crp is highly conserved among streptomycetes and can influence precursor abundance, the activity of pathway-specific regulators, and the expression of metabolic clusters lacking cognate regulators.;  These data, and the extent of Crp interactions across the genome, indicate that Crp overexpression has the potential to be a powerful, multifaceted avenue for new secondary metabolite production.; Crp induction has broad effects on both primary and secondary metabolism.;  Here, we find that Crp directly controls the expression of several enzymes contributing to acetyl-CoA accumulation (SCO4921 and SCO5261).;  The preferred substrate for many polyketide synthase enzymes, however, is malonyl-CoA, whose synthesis requires the activity of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme complex (ACCase) (37), whose subunits were either directly (accA1 and accA2) or indirectly (accBE) regulated by Crp.;  We find here that Crp adds an additional dimension to this regulatory interplay: comparisons of previous transcriptomic studies (44, 45) revealed the expression of 24 genes to be affected by both AfsS and PhoP, and of these, nearly half were also influenced by Crp induction in our transcriptomic studies.;  A further 25 AfsS and 38 PhoP regulon-specific members were also affected by Crp activity (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).;  An important future goal will be to define the conditions that stimulate Crp activity and to fully elucidate the regulatory networks connecting primary metabolism with secondary metabolism.; The ability of Crp to modulate fundamental aspects of primary metabolism while at the same time directly to govern the expression of secondary metabolic gene clusters is reminiscent of DasR activity in S. coelicolor.;  The critical difference between Crp and DasR lies at the heart of their regulatory behavior: Crp functions predominantly as an activator, while DasR acts as a repressor (12, 46).;  Crp induction led to increased expression for the majority of biosynthetic genes in the Red, CDA, yCPK, and SCO6429-38 gene clusters (Fig. 3).;  Expression from the actVI operon was activated after 60 min of Crp induction; this was the final time point examined in our transcriptome profiling experiments, and it is likely that expression of the remaining genes would have been upregulated after this time.;  It is worth noting that Crp also has repressor activity, as seen for the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone-encoding genes.;  Interestingly, Crp induction also led to repression of a gene encoding a related terpene synthase responsible for geosmin production (48), although this effect appeared to be indirect.;  The increased cAMP levels observed in a crp mutant also suggested a repressive role for Crp in cAMP accumulation; however, this also appears to be indirect, as Crp did not associate with sequences near the cya (adenylate cyclase-encoding) gene, nor did Crp induction impact cya expression in our transcriptomic experiments.; In S. coelicolor, Crp exerts its regulatory influence by associating with sequences similar to those identified for Crp in other bacteria (22, 23).;  In E. coli, these binding sites are typically found immediately upstream or overlapping the −35 promoter element, where Crp binding facilitates RNA polymerase recruitment (31).;  Here, Crp frequently bound multiple sites within any given region, including at least one intragenic site; intergenic sites were often significantly upstream of any mapped promoter, as was seen for the majority of secondary metabolic clusters shown in Table 1.;  This unexpected coding sequence association was not restricted to secondary metabolite gene regulation; more than 50% of all Crp-associated sequences were within open reading frames.;  Crp in E. coli can bind within coding regions; however, these are primarily low-affinity binding sites (16), whereas here, seven of the top 10 interaction scores for Crp were intragenic, and the highest-affinity sites associated with most secondary metabolic genes were within coding regions.;  Collectively, this suggests a very different mechanism of Crp-mediated gene activation in S. coelicolor than that described for E. coli, as none of these intragenic binding sites appear to be associated with internal promoters, as determined by RNA Seq analyses (M.;  Intragenic binding is increasingly being observed for transcription factors throughout bacteria: in Salmonella, nearly half of SsrB binding sites are coding region associated (49), and a similar situation has been seen for AbrB and Abh in Bacillus subtilis (50), while in Pseudomonas syringae, the Crp-related Fur protein associates with intragenic sequences with an affinity comparable to that for intergenic sites (51).;  A major difference in the intragenic binding by these transcription factors, and that of Crp in S. coelicolor, however, is that the intragenic Crp sites were frequently associated with transcriptional effects (both activation and repression), whereas for the other regulators, such effects were not commonly seen (49–51).; Our work here reveals an important new role for the well-studied Crp regulator in the control of antibiotic production.;  To date, Crp is one of the only global antibiotic regulators for which direct regulatory connections to a broad range of secondary metabolic pathways have been established.;  Furthermore, we have shown that its ability to stimulate secondary metabolite production is not limited to S. coelicolor, and our results suggest that Crp overexpression is a useful strategy for accessing the previously untapped reservoirs of Streptomyces antibiotics and other natural products.; To create a Crp overexpression plasmid, the crp coding sequence was PCR amplified (see Table S4 in the supplemental material) and ligated into pET15b (see Table S3).;  His6-Crp expression was induced overnight at 26°C with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), before the cells were collected and lysed using a French press.;  Purified His6-Crp was used to generate polyclonal antibodies (Cedarlane Labs).;  The column was washed five times with equilibration buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4), after which anti-Crp antiserum was passed through the column, and the flowthrough was collected as the precleared antiserum.;  The precleared antiserum was then further affinity purified using Ni-NTA-immobilized His6-Crp and was eluted with 2 ml of a high-salt (4 M MgCl2) buffer, before buffer exchange into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).;  The protein extracts were separated using SDS-PAGE and either were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (to ensure equivalent protein concentrations in all samples) or were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Crp polyclonal antibodies (1:2,000) and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3,000; Cell Signaling).;  In each binding reaction, 0, 27, or 81 μM Crp protein was incubated with 15,000 cpm of DNA probe at 30°C for 15 min in the presence of 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 µg poly(dI-dC), and 50 μM cAMP.; Transcriptional and translational levels of Crp in wild-type cells over a 48-h time course. (A) RNA samples prepared from cells harvested at different time points were subjected to reverse transcription and PCR to evaluate the quantity of crp transcripts. 16S rRNA was included as a control.;  Crp protein was detected using immunoblotting.; Crp interacts with the upstream regions of SCO3571 (crp), SCO4561, and SCO2977 in DNase I footprinting assays.

ER,2099,20599778,2934894," Estrogen Receptor (ER) dimerization is required for target gene transcription.;  The three ER dimer pairs (ERα/α homodimers, ERβ/β homodimers, and ERα/β heterodimers) exhibit diverse physiological responses in response to ligand-dependent activation with ERα/α homodimers being pro-proliferative and ERβ/β homodimers being anti-proliferative.;  The biological role of the ERα/β heterodimer remains unclear.;  We previously developed a cell-based, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay that can distinguish natural estrogenic compounds based on their abilities to activate the three diverse ER dimer pairs.;  Using BRET assays, we sought to identify novel xenoestrogens from soil bacteria that preferentially activate ERα/β heterodimer with hopes of shedding light on the biological function of this elusive dimer pair.;  Here we describe the application of BRET assays in high throughput screens of crude bacterial extracts not previously screened for ER modulatory function and originating from unique ecological niches.;  Here we report the discovery and biological evaluation of a new natural product, actinopolymorphol A (1), that preferentially induces ERα/β dimerization.;  Actinopolymorphol A represents the first representative of a new ER modulatory scaffold.; The Estrogen Receptors (ERs) are hormone dependent transcription factors existing in two forms: ERα and ERβ. The binding of both endogenous (i.e. 17β-estradiol, also known as E2) and exogenous estrogenic ligands to these receptors induces conformational changes leading to dissociation from the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex, subsequent receptor dimerization, interaction with coactivator proteins, and recognition of Estrogen Response Elements (EREs) in the promoter regions of target genes to activate target gene transcription.;  Transcriptional activity of ERs is strongly influenced by ligands at each step including (i) the binding of a given ligand for ERα vs.;  ERβ, (ii) the conformational changes induced upon ligand binding which influence dimer partner preference (i.e.;  ERα/α and ERβ/β homodimers, or ERα/β heterodimers), (iii) cofactor recruitment, and, (iv) interaction with chromatin.;  The differential regulation of ERα and ERβ by endogenous and exogenous estrogenic compounds has extensive physiological implications, as transcriptional activation of ERα by these ligands is known to stimulate cellular proliferation, while transcriptional activation of ERβ inhibits cell growth [1-6].; In addition to the genomic transcriptional activities of ERα and ERβ in estrogenic signaling, ERs can also be regulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) [7-10]. The effects of many of these growth factor pathways are believed to reflect their abilities to change the phosphorylation state of ERs, as well as that of coregulators and other proteins with which ERs interact to modulate gene expression.;  Membrane-bound ERs have been shown to mediate estrogenic effects in ER-negative cells via activation of the MAPK pathway [11]. These non-genomic mechanisms of estrogenic signaling should therefore be carefully considered as important mechanisms of global estrogen action.; The cellular functions of ERα and ERβ homodimers are well-established.;  However, the biological role of the ERα/β heterodimer remains a topic for intense study and debate, due largely to the lack of tools to study ERα/β heterodimerization in a physiological context.;  The coexpression of ERα and ERβ results in a heterogeneous pool of homodimers and heterodimers, and thus the activity of heterodimers cannot be deciphered from that of either homodimer, although evidence strongly suggests that ERβ antagonizes the proliferative action of ERα via formation of growth-inhibitory heterodimers [1, 3, 4, 12, 13]. To elucidate the biological role of these heterodimers, we have developed novel Bioluminescent Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assays in order to study ERα/β heterodimerization in a cell-based, physiological environment in real time [14]. We have used these assays to study the basic intermolecular mechanism of ERα/β heterodimerization.;  Another important application of the BRET assay involves the identification of selective ERα/β heterodimer-inducing small molecules.;  Of particular significance here is the application of the BRET assay to identify new natural products able to activate ERα/β heterodimerization.;  Metabolites of xenoestrogenic and phytoestrogenic compounds have been demonstrated to be produced by several bacterial strains including those present in the intestinal flora [15-20] and soil bacteria [21, 22]. For example, bisphenol A (BPA) can be metabolized by many organisms ranging from microorganisms to animals, and these transformations represent an important pathway for its detoxification [23]. Other studies have shown that many natural products produced by bacteria serve as xenoestrogens [24, 25]. Screening of such compounds for their ability to selectively activate ER homodimers and heterodimers is important in order to determine the physiological effects of these environmental ligands as they may act through pro-proliferative ERα/α homodimers or anti-proliferative ERβ/β heterodimers.;  Moreover, the identification of such compounds represents an important undertaking as compounds displaying selective ER activation may serve as scaffolds which may be used for the development of novel therapeutics or biochemical tools.;  Inspired by the realization that the chemical structures of natural products remain either the source of, or the basis for, the majority of drug discovery and synthesis [26], this study sought to identify new natural products able to induce selective ER heterodimer formation leading to subsequent transcriptional activity with the rationale that these structures may be useful as a basis for chemical synthesis of therapeutically-useful ER dimer-selective ligands.; The application of our novel ER dimer-specific BRET assay [14, 27] for high throughput screening (HTS) of a microbial library of crude extracts resulted in the identification of actinopolymorphol A from the actinomycete Actinopolymorpha rutilus whose structure has not previously been reported or characterized as an ER ligand.;  ERα/α homodimerization was examined using ERα-RLuc and ERα-YFP, ERβ/β homodimerization was examined using RLuc-ERβ and YFP-ERβ, and ERα/β heterodimerization was examined using ERα-RLuc and YFP-ERβ using the optimized conditions described previously [14]. Cells were transfected with these fusion proteins (0.73 μg RLuc fusion + 2.8 μg YFP fusion) in batches on 10 cm plates to reduce well-to-well variation in Phenol Red Free DMEM + 5% SFS.;  ERα/α homodimers were plated in quadrant 1, ERβ/β homodimers were plated in quadrant 2, and ERα/β heterodimers were plated in quadrants 3 and 4).; HEK293 cells were transfected in batches in 48-well plates using 2.5 ng of each indicated ER and 50 ng tk-ERE-luc vector per well as described above.;  Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 1 hour (for ERα) or 2 hours (for ERβ) at 0.35 A.;  Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk (for ERα) or 10% nonfat milk (for ERβ) in PBS Tween.;  ERα was detected with a 1:10,000 dilution of Santa Cruz HC-20, and ERβ was detected with a 1:5000 dilution of Santa Cruz H-150. β-actin was detected with a 1:5000 dilution of Sigma A5441.;  DNA was digested with DNase I, and RNA was quantitated using the Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). cDNA was reverse transcribed from RNA using the Superscript II Reverse Transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and PCR amplification was performed using the following primers: ERα Forward 5′ TTATGGAGTCTGGTCCTGTG 3′, Reverse 5′ CATCATTCCCACTTCGTAGC 3′; ERβ Forward 5′ TTTGGGTGATTGCCAAGAGC 3′, Reverse 5′ AGCACGTGGGCATTCAGC 3′; β-actin Forward 5′AGGCACCAGGGCGTGATGGT 3′, Reverse 5′ GGTCTCAAACATGATCTGGG 3′.; The binding affinity of ligands for ERα and ERβ was measured using Estrogen Receptor Competitor Assays from Invitrogen (PanVera) (Part # P2614, P2698 for ERα; Part # P2615, P2700 for ERβ) according to the manufacturer's instructions.;  Using purified ERα or ERβ provided in the kit, serial dilutions of test compounds were prepared ranging in concentration from 2 mM to 20 pM by preparing 1:10 dilutions in provided screening buffer.;  The concentration of DMSO was kept below 1%. Compounds were diluted 2-fold in the final reaction with a mixture of 30 nM purified ERα, 2 nM Fluormone, and screening buffer such that the final concentration of test ligand was serially diluted 1 mM to 10 pM, the final concentration of ERα was 15 nM, and the final concentration of Fluormone was 1 nM.;  Test ligands were prepared in a similar fashion for ERβ using a final concentration of 10 nM ERβ. This mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours, and polarization values were read in individual glass tubes using a Beacon 2000 instrument.; Crystal structure of ERα-estradiol (2OCF.pdb) and ERβ-estradiol (2J7X.pdb) complex were retrieved from PDB databank (http://www.rcsb.org).;  The minimized actinopolymorphol A was docked into the ligand binding pocket of each ER using Glide (Glide, version 5.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2008) software package using with standard parameters (SP).; In order to identify ligands capable of differentially inducing ERα/α and ERβ/β homodimerization and ERα/β heterodimerization, a BRET assay was developed and optimized [14]. Distinct from the existing ER reporter assay, the BRET assay is exquisitely sensitive and allows the formation of different dimer types to be detected independently, including ERα/α, ERβ/β, and ERα/β dimers.;  This is especially important in the case of the ERα/β heterodimer, as the co-expression of ERα and ERβ allows the formation of all three dimer pairs, which prevents a clearly delineated understanding of heterodimer function in vivo.;  The BRET assay allows the visualization of ERα/β heterodimers and downstream function without interference from either homodimer.;  This assay involved the transfection of DNA encoding an ERα-Renilla Luciferase (RLuc) fusion protein and an ERβ-YFP fusion protein into ER-negative HEK293 cells.;  The high transfectability (>90%), low doubling time, and ER-negative status of this cell line made it an attractive candidate for the high throughput ER BRET screening, as interference from endogenous ERs was not a concern.;  Coelenterazine h induces RLuc emission at ∼470 nm; if ER dimerization has occurred, YFP is in close proximity to RLuc, which results in resonance energy transfer to YFP and its emission at 530 nm.;  Because the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 also induces dimerization [14], vehicle (DMSO) served as the sole negative control.;  HEK293 cells transfected with the ER-RLuc fusion alone (in the absence of YFP) were included on each plate and treated with the vehicle DMSO in order to calculate the Correction Factor portion of the BRET ratio [14]. Each compound was tested in an ERα/α homodimer BRET assay, an ERβ/β homodimer BRET assay, and an ERα/β heterodimer BRET assay.;  ERα/α homodimers were plated in quadrant 1, ERβ/β homodimers were plated in quadrant 2, and ERα/β heterodimers were plated in quadrants 3 and 4).;  This assay setup allowed verification of the specificity of each primary hit compound based on its ability to activate ERα/β heterodimers in comparison with its ability to activate each respective homodimer.;  Finally, it is well established that terrestrial microbes are a rich source for xenoestrogens [21, 22, 30-33]. This realization supported our hypothesis that crude extracts from the WDL might be an excellent source of ER modulators.; HTS ERα/β heterodimer BRET assays were performed on selected members of the WDL, and crude extracts capable of inducing ERα/β heterodimerization were re-tested alongside each homodimer pair.;  A total of 25% of the extracts induced ERα/β heterodimerization, and the strongest 1% (10 extracts) were re-tested alongside each homodimer pair.;  This high number of heterodimer-inducing compounds is likely due to the large size and flexibility of the ERα and ERβ LBD, which is accommodating for a variety of chemical structures.;  Natural product extract SB83e appeared to exhibit a preference for inducing ERα/β heterodimerization relative to either homodimer pair (Figure 2), and was therefore chosen for subsequent investigation.;  While a low level of ERα/α homodimerization was also induced by this extract, the crude mixture of multiple compounds did not preclude the possibility of a heterodimer-specific compound coexistent with a dimer non-selective compound.; BRET HTS identifies one Natural product extract SB83e capable of preferentially inducing anti-proliferative ERβ/β and ERα/β dimers while minimally inducing pro-proliferative ERα/α homodimers.;  SB83e 1:10 diluted or non-diluted was incubated with HEK293 cells transfected with different pairs of ER fusion plasmids for one-hour before reading of Rluc and YFP signals.; Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the crude extract SB83e led to the identification of one discrete compound, actinopolymorphol A, responsible for ERα/β heterodimerization observed in BRET assays (Huang et al., submitted for publication).;  Actinopolymorphol A (Figure 3a, inset) was found to activate the transcriptional activity of ERβ alone and ERα + ERβ, but was not able to activate the transcriptional activity of ERα alone.;  These BRET assays showed an optimal 5-fold increase in ERα/β heterodimerization at 100 μM purified actinopolymorphol A, and this concentration minimally induced either homodimer (less than 1.5 fold). 10 μM purified actinopolymorphol A likewise induced 3-fold induction for ERα/β heterodimers; at this concentration neither ERα/α or ERβ/β homodimerization was induced (Figure 3a).;  Similarly, both 10 μM and 100 μM exhibited a preference for the transcriptional induction of both ERβ alone and ERα + ERβ, but not ERα alone (Figure 3b).;  The fold-induction of both the BRET ratio and transcriptional activity of ERα + ERβ was greater than that obtained with ERβ alone, indicating that this compound retains some level of heterodimer selectivity.;  Furthermore, this transcriptional activity on an ERE-luciferase reporter was shown to be ER-specific in the presence of the ER pure antagonist ICI 182,780 (Figure 3b).;  ICI 182,780 completely abrogated actinopolymorphol A-dependent reporter activity in the presence of ERα + ERβ (Figure 3b).;  This is in contrast to the failure of ICI 182,780 to reduce the basal transcriptional activity of ERβ homodimer alone (Figure 3b).;  ERβ was previously found to display a high level of ligand-independent dimerization [14] and transcriptional activity [34]. The apparent discrepancy between BRET and reporter assays for ERβ/β homodimers at 10 μM purified actinopolymorphol A is likely due to the lower sensitivity of the ERβ/β homodimer BRET assay relative to the reporter assay because the BRET assay only captures receptor dimerization transiently whereas the reporter assay detects accumulated product formation over time.;  Synthetic actinopolymorphol A was confirmed to retain its ability to selectively induce ERα/β dimerization (Figure 4a) and to enhance transcriptional activity (Figure 4b) of ERs in a fashion comparable to the natural product from A. rutilus.;  Thus, because this compound selectively induced the activity of anti-proliferative ERβ/β homodimers and ERα/β heterodimers while not having a pronounced effect on the activity of proliferative ERα/α homodimers, we hypothesized that this compound may be able to inhibit cell growth by enhancing ERβ dimerization leading to a dampening of the proliferative effects of ERα.; Dimer selective natural product extract SB83e was fractionated, and the constituent compound responsible for dimer selectivity was identified and purified. (a) BRET assays showing the dimer selectivity of actinopolymorphol A for ERβ/β and ERα/β. (b) ERE-luciferase assays in HEK293 cells showing the ability of actinopolymorphol A to induce the transcription of ERα alone (ERα homodimers), ERβ alone (ERβ homodimers), or ERα + ERβ (all three dimer pairs).;  The transcriptional response is ablated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780.; The dimer selectivity for synthetic actinopolymorphol A was confirmed via BRET assays (a) and ERE-luciferase assays in HEK293 cells (b).; Synthetic actinopolymorphol A was used in cell proliferation and viability assays in ERα and ERβ positive cell lines to determine its effect on cell growth.;  Figure 5a shows confirmation of ERα and ERβ expression in these cell lines by RT-PCR (left panel) and western blotting (right panel).;  Consistent with previous reports, HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells and PC3 human prostate cancer cells have both ERα and ERβ co-expressed [2, 35]. Figure 5b shows the effect of the novel compound in HC11 cells (top panels) and PC3 cells (bottom panels) on cell number (left panels) and viability (right panels).;  We hypothesize that the difference in the compound's ability to influence cell growth in these two cell lines depends on the relative expression level of ERα and ERβ as well as the expression levels of coactivator and corepressor proteins.;  The effect of actinopolymorphol A on growth and viability cannot be completely reversed by the antagonist ICI 182,780 in ER-positive HC11 and PC3 cells (Figure S1), suggesting that other pathways, including non-genomic estrogenic signaling pathways, could be partially responsible for this compound's effects on cell growth.; The synthetic actinopolymorphol A inhibits cell growth. (a) ERα and ERβ expression in PC3 and HC11 cells was confirmed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR (left panel) and western blotting (right panel). β-actin served as a loading control. (b) Cell growth and viability were decreased by treatment with the synthetic actinopolymorphol A in both cell lines as determined by cell counting and trypan blue staining.; In order to determine the binding affinity of actinopolymorphol A to ERα and ERβ, we employed in vitro Fluorescence Polarization (FP) Competition Binding Assays.;  Measurements of the binding affinity of actinopolymorphol A for recombinant ER proteins using this assay were validated commercially [36, 37] and in our experiment using the characterized compound genistein (Figure 6a).;  Genistein has been reported to have a ∼10 fold greater binding affinity for ERβ over ERα [38], and our results showed a ∼15 fold greater binding affinity for ERβ (Figure 6a).;  As shown in Figure 6b, actinopolymorphol A was able to effectively compete with fluorescently labeled E2 for binding to both ERα and ERβ with a ∼ 2-fold higher affinity for binding to ERβ. This data strongly suggests the ability of this compound to bind within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERα and ERβ, and furthermore, the differential binding affinity likely contributes to the compound's ability to selectively activate ERβ/β homodimers relative to ERα/α homodimers.;  The IC50 values for actinopolymorphol A binding to ERα and ERβ were 29 μM and 15 μM, respectively, correlating to Ki values of 6.2 μM and 4.3 μM, respectively.; Fluorescence Polarization Competition Binding assays for ERα and ERβ. (a) Genistein binds to ERα and ERβ with different affinities consistent with previous reports and served as a positive control for the Flouresence Polarization Competition Binding Assay. (b) The synthetic actinopolymorphol A binds to ERβ with 2-fold higher affinity than to ERα.; Molecular modeling indicated that actinopolymorphol A is well accommodated in the agonist conformation in the LBD of both ERα and ERβ (Figure 7).;  The C-3 hydroxyl group of A-ring of 17β-estradiol forms strong hydrogen bonds with conserved residues Glu353 and Arg394 from one side of the ligand binding pocket of ERα (Glu260 and Arg301 in ERβ) (Figure 7b and 7d).;  The 17β-hydroxyl of estradiol makes direct hydrogen bond with the residue His524 on the other side of the binding pocket of ERα (His430 in ERβ).;  The phenolic hydroxyl group of actinopolymorphol A mimics the C-3 hydroxyl group of 17β-estradiol and participates in the same kind of hydrogen bond interactions observed with residues Glu and Arg in both ERs' binding pockets.;  However, by virtue of its limited size and simple architecture, actinopolymorphol A cannot extend to the right side of the LBD pocket to form tight interactions with residue His514 in ERα or His430 in ERβ, which is likely responsible for the lower docking scores compared to E2.;  The relatively similar docking scores of actinopolymorphol A to ERα (-8.13) and ERβ (-8.02) agree well with our findings of similar Ki values from Fluorescence Polarization competition binding assays.;  Thus, based on the binding mode predicted by this molecular modeling, more potent ER dimer-selective estrogenic compounds could be designed based on the structure of this scaffold.;  A and D, Superimposition of actinopolymorphol A and 17β-estradiol in the ligand binding domain of ERα (A) and ERβ (D).;  B and E, important interaction between estradiol and residues in the ligand binding pocket of ERα (B) and ERβ (E).;  C and F, Important interactions between actinopolymorphol A and residues in the ligand binding pocket of ERα (C) and ERβ (F).; It is well-established that phytochemicals serve as recruitment signals resulting in the symbiotic activation of plant growth signals by soil bacteria, and that the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) contained in pesticides and other industrial by-products can disrupt this process [38-40]. The direct production of xenoestrogenic compounds by soil bacteria is not as well established and therefore represents an opportunity for discovery of new chemical scaffolds with possible utility as, or the potential for optimization of, ER modulators.;  The University of Wisconsin's WDL contains crude bacterial extracts consisting of various natural products and was therefore screened using three highly optimized BRET assays to identify novel inducers of ERα/α and ERβ/β homodimerization as well as ERα/β heterodimerization.;  The application of these BRET assays to screen identify new ER modulators from crude extracts obtained from actinomycetes originating from unique ecological niches resulted in the identification of a novel, previously uncharacterized, dimer selective ER agonist named actinopolymorphol A.;  Two types of high throughput assays are popularly used for large-scale screening of ER structural scaffolds and agonists or antagonist ligands.;  A fluorescence polarization (FP) method that measures the capacity of a competitor chemical to displace a high affinity fluorescent E2 from purified, recombinant ERα or ERβ have been adapted for testing environmental chemicals for ER binding interactions [36]. However, this method requires pure preparation of receptor, and the fluorescence from the test compounds could interfere with fluorescence readout [36]. Thus far this method has been restricted to use with pure compounds and has not been applicable to whole cell extracts or bioassay-guided fractionation efforts.;  The BRET assays described herein circumvent this issue because the library extract or compound in question needs only to be incubated with cells expressing ER fusion proteins for 1 hour to induce dimerization.;  Furthermore, the three possible ER dimer pairs (ERα/α homodimers, ERβ/β homodimers, and ERα/β heterodimers) may be directly examined in parallel yet in isolation from each other, thus providing an added layer of sensitivity and complexity to the library extract or compound's ability to act as an agonist or antagonist ligand.;  Using this BRET screening method, the crude extract from A. rutilus was found to selectivity induce formation and transcriptional activity of ERβ/β homodimers and ERα/β heterodimers.;  Different from the classical genomic signaling through EREs, these non-genomic signaling pathways initiated at the cell membrane may also require receptor dimerization and couples with a variety of other signaling partners that can eventually culminate in the phosphorylation of transcription factors and their partners, ultimately influencing transcriptional outcome, and thus physiological effects such as cell division and apoptosis.; It is worth noting that BRET assays measure the ligand's ability to induce receptor dimerization and the FP method measures ligand replacement of E2 in ER pocket; neither of these assays can distinguish agonists from antagonists.;  Transcriptional reporter assays measure the ability of the lead compound to induce or inhibit (in the presence of E2) transcription of ER subtypes, allowing determination of agonist or antagonist activity of a ligand.;  For example, while a low level of ERα/α homodimerization was induced by this compound and substantiated via the BRET assay, these proliferative dimers were not transcriptionally active in ERE-luciferase reporter assays.; The structure of this novel ER dimer-selective natural product from A. rutilus was determined by NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis and its absolute stereochemistry was established by total synthesis using an optically pure starting material ((S)-2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid). (Huang et al., submitted for publication).;  Molecular modeling suggests that, although the phenolic hydroxyl group of actinopolymorphol A mimics the C-3 hydroxyl group of 17β-estradiol and makes the same hydrogen bond interactions with residues Glu and Arg in both ERs' binding pockets (Figure 7), other structural elements of the natural product do not strictly adhere to predictions likely to be made on the basis of other ER ligands such as tamoxifen or raloxifene.;  The modeled structure explains how actinopolymorphol A may compete with E2 in binding to the same LBD in FP assay while also displaying a lower binding affinity due to the absence of functionalities needed to H-bond with histidine distal to the Glu and Arg end of the ER LBD.;  This modeling indicates that the agonist or partial agonist conformation is adopted by ERα and ERβ and that their ligand binding cavities are shaped into a low-energy conformation by actinopolymorphol A.;  Perhaps most significantly, actinopolymorphol A is, to the best of our knowledge, the first ER dimerization modulator identified from actinomycetes.;  As such, discovery of this natural product and subsequent association with ER modulatory function unveils a new molecular scaffold with a novel and potentially useful bioactivity.; The application of ER BRET assays for high throughput screening of crude natural product extracts and subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation leading to the identification of actinopolymorphol A showcases a new molecular scaffold but also highlights the utility of BRET assays in discovering new, otherwise difficult to detect, natural products with ER modulatory activity.;  These ER modulatory compounds may function through genomic or non-genomic signaling pathways.;  Follow-up assays showed that actinopolymorphol A is able to act as an agonist on ERs and can decrease the growth of ERα and ERβ positive cell lines while not adversely affecting their viability.;  Despite its low activity on ERs, this novel structure is able to compete with endogenous E2 for LBD binding in both ERα and ERβ. Competitive LBD binding by actinopolymorphol A is rationalized on the basis of molecular modeling which suggests the natural product can induce an agonist conformation upon binding to both ERs.;  Combined, these data reveal the unique application of BRET assays to find new ER modulators and reveal actinomycetes as a potentially rich source of such bioactive natural products, the apparent first example of which, highlights a unique molecular scaffold which may serve as a lead for drug discovery and therapeutic intervention in ER dependent diseases such as breast and prostate cancers.;  MTT assays reflecting the metabolic activity of alive cells show that cell proliferation in ER-positive HC11 (top panels) and PC3 (bottom panels) is inhibited (left panels), and this inhibition is retained in the presence of the antagonist ICI 182,780 (right panels), indicating the possibility for the activity of actinopolymorphol A on non-genomic signaling pathways. * indicates p<0.05.",

Esi,5266,28535774,5442856,"We identified a transcription regulator Esi for the biosynthesis of epothilones.;  Esi was able to bind, probably via the N-terminus of the protein, to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter of the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster.;  The Esi-homologous sequences retrieved from the RefSeq database are all of the Proteobacteria.;  However, the Esi regulation is not universal in myxobacteria, because the esi gene exists only in a few myxobacterial genomes.; Esi binds to the epothilone promoter and down-regulates the transcriptional level of the whole gene cluster to affect the biosynthesis of epothilone.;  The results suggested that the SCE1572_25030 gene probably encoded an epothilone synthesis inhibitor (Esi).;  Accordingly, Esi is a negative regulator for the production of epothilones, functioning not only in the producing Sorangium strains, but also in Myxococcus.; To investigate the regulation mechanism of Esi on the production of epothilones, we comparatively analyzed the transcriptional levels of epothilone biosynthetic genes in the esi-deletion and overexpression mutants with their parent strain M. xanthus ZE9 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).;  The above RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that Esi negatively regulated the transcription of epothilone genes.;  Esi ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""WP_020736929.1"",""term_id"":""522824230"",""term_text"":""WP_020736929.1""}}WP_020736929.1) is a protein with 373 amino acids in size.;  We constructed the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Esi protein using the I-TASSER and QUARK programs.;  Based on the constructed model, the Esi protein contained three regions, i.e. an N-terminal domain, a linker region and a C-terminal domain, with the isoelectric points of 6.90, 5.87 and 5.95, respectively (Fig. 4a).; The structure modeling of Esi protein and the DNA-Esi binding complex. a Positions of N-terminal domain, linker region and C-terminal domain. b The structure model of Esi protein.;  The C-terminal region is a cupin-like domain. c The DNA–protein complex structure of Esi protein (blue) and epothilone promoter (red).;  The top of the N-terminal domain of Esi binds with the promoter DNA sequence;  We reconstructed a 3D structure of the epothilone promoter using w3DNA, and then calculated to determine the best complex structure of Esi-promoter by using nucleic acid-protein dock (NPDock).;  The results suggested that the N-terminal domain of Esi connected with the promoter DNA sequence (Fig. 4c).;  According to the DNA–protein complex structure, we suggested that the inverted repeat was the best Esi-binding region.;  The Esi protein might work as a dimer, and the two N-terminal domains bind specifically to the inverted GGGA of the double-strand promoter DNA sequence.;  To determine the molecular mechanism of Esi regulation on the epothilone synthesis, we assayed the binding activity between Esi and the 17-bp operator DNA sequence of epothilone promoter.;  The Esi protein was tagged with a 6-His sequence.;  After induction with 0.1 mM IPTG, the Esi proteins were extracted from the cultivated cells, and purified based on the fused His-tag (Fig. 5a).
; 
a The purified Esi protein with His-tag was detected by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomasie brilliant blue staining.;  Lanes 1, 2, and 3 represented purified His-Esi protein; Lane M represented molecular mass standards (from top to bottom, 116, 66.2, 45, 35, 25, 18.4, 14.4 kDa). b EMSA showing the binding of His-Esi protein to the 17-bp operator DNA sequence of epothilone promoter.;  Lane 1 represented free DNA with no His-Esi protein; Lanes 2 to 6 represented DNA incubated with increased concentrations of His-Esi;  Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was performed to detect the specific binding activity of Esi and the 17-bp sequence.;  The results clearly showed that the His-Esi protein was able to bind to the biotin-labeled DNA.;  If the molar ratio of protein and DNA was increased, the more DNA was blocked (Fig. 5b), which indicated that the His-Esi protein bound specifically with operator DNA, rather than the nonspecific competition DNA (Poly dI–dC).; Using the Esi amino acid sequence as a seed, we iteratively searched the homologous sequences in RefSeq database using the psi-BLAST program, and found 156 Esi-homologues with more than 90% of alignment coverage.;  The genes encoding for the 156 Esi homologous proteins distributed in 203 different bacterial genomes (Additional file 2: Table S1), all belonging to the Proteobacteria.;  These genomes contained single esi gene copy, except Pseudomonas fluorescens FW300-N2C3, which contained two genes encoding for the Esi homologous proteins.;  The results indicated that the Esi regulation mechanism was not universal in myxobacteria.; All of the Esi proteins had a length ranging from 356aa to 419aa, and their functions have not been reported, indicating that the esi gene codes a novel negative regulator.;  The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid residue in the Esi homologue proteins was calculated using ConSurf [41], which showed that the C-terminal domain had the highest conservation, followed by the N-terminal domain and the linker region (Additional file 3: Figure S2).;  Because of high similarities of their amino acid sequences, these homologous proteins were suggested to have similar 3D structures as the Esi protein described in this paper, probably playing functions as transcriptional regulation factors like the Esi protein.; In this paper, we determined that the Esi protein played as a transcription regulator for epothilone biosynthesis.;  The Esi binds, probably via the N-terminus of the protein, to the inverted repeat of epothilone promoter and down-regulates the transcription of each gene in the gene cluster to suppress epothilones synthesis.;  Esi regulation is not universal in myxobacteria.; The Esi protein contained three regions, i.e. an N-terminal domain, a linker region and a C-terminal domain.;  The Esi protein connected with an operator of the promoter for the biosynthesis of epothilones, and the operator sequence contained a 4-bp inverted repeat in a 17-bp DNA fragment.;  We speculated that Esi worked in a similar way as HrcA [32, 33]: two molecules of Esi protein interacted to each other through the C-terminal domain, forming a mirrored dimer and the two N-terminal domains bind to the 4-bp inverted repeat of each DNA strand to repress transcription initiation.;  Although bacterial Esi proteins have not yet been studied, many of the homologous proteins were annotated to be cupin, a diverse superfamily of proteins named after its conserved barrel domain [42, 43] or transcription factor jumonji, a protein having a DNA binding domain and two conserved jmj domains [44]. The JmjC domains have been identified to play transcription factors in numerous eukaryotic proteins, such as PHD, C2H2, ARID/BRIGHT and zinc fingers, functioning by a histone demethylation mechanism that is conserved from yeast to human [44, 45]. However, since there is no histone in prokaryotes, the functioning mechanism of Esi was not like the eukaryotic JmjC proteins, and detailed molecular functioning pattern requires further investigations.;  E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used to express the Esi protein.;  The galactose-resistant but Km-sensitive colonies were screened and checked by colony PCR with primers Esi-up F and Esi-down R.;  The knockout mutant, designated as ZE9∆Esi, was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products.;  The mutant strain ZE9 att::Esi was purified by being gradient diluted, mixed with soft agar (0.5%), and spread on CYE plates with 5 μg/mL of Tet.; So0157-2 and So0157-2-Esi− were cultured in M26 medium (8 g/L potato starch, 2 g/L soy peptone, 2 g/L glucose, 2 g/L yeast powder, 1 g/L MgSO4, 1 g/L CaCl2, 1 mL/L EDTA-Fe3+, 1 mL/L microelement, pH 7.2) for 3 days and inoculated into 50 mL of EPM medium (4.7 g/L dextrin, 1.7 g/L soybean cake powder, 0.8 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L saccharose, 2.2 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L CaCl2, 2 mL/L EDTA-Fe33+, 1 mL/L corn steep liquor, 1 mL/L microelement, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2% of resin XAD 16 for the absorbtion of epothilone products.;  Esi protein domain was annotated by SMART [49] and PFAM [50]. We constructed the N-terminal domain of Esi protein by ab initio protein folding and protein structure prediction with QUARK program [51], and then modeled the three-dimensional structures model of the whole Esi protein using the I-TASSER program based on a threading approach [52]. All the structural models were refined in the atomic-level by the fragment-guided molecular dynamics (FG-MD) simulations [53]. According to quality assessment by Ramachandran plot [40], the accuracy of the protein structural models were acceptable.;  The three-dimensional nucleic-acid structures of the epothilone promoter sequence was reconstructed with w3DNA server [54]. The NPDock (Nucleic acid-Protein Dock) was used to model the complex structures of Esi protein and epothilone promoter [55].; The position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) [56] was used to search for homologous proteins of Esi in the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference sequence (RefSeq) database [57]. The amino acid sequence of Esi protein was used as query sequence.;  A multiple sequence alignment of the Esi protein and its homologous proteins was established using the MAFFT program [58]. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid positions in the Esi protein and its homologous sequences was estimated by using ConSurf algorithm [41]. The JTT substitution matrix was used and the computation was based on the empirical Bayesian paradigm.;  The sequence and modeled structure of the Esi protein were shown in nine-color conservation grades.;  For the heterologous expression of Esi, 500 mL LB medium containing Km was inoculated with 5 mL of the overnight culture, prepared from a single colony, and grown at 37 °C for about 2 h. 0.1 mM IPTG was added at an optical density (OD600 nm) of 0.8.;  After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight with Ni–nitrilotriacetic acid HiszBind resin (Novagen), and then eluated with Lysis Buffer containing gradient imidazole ranging from 20 to 250 Mm to collect soluble purified Esi protein.",
Estrogen Receptor,2099,20599778,2934894," Estrogen Receptor (ER) dimerization is required for target gene transcription.; The Estrogen Receptors (ERs) are hormone dependent transcription factors existing in two forms: ERα and ERβ. The binding of both endogenous (i.e. 17β-estradiol, also known as E2) and exogenous estrogenic ligands to these receptors induces conformational changes leading to dissociation from the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex, subsequent receptor dimerization, interaction with coactivator proteins, and recognition of Estrogen Response Elements (EREs) in the promoter regions of target genes to activate target gene transcription.; The binding affinity of ligands for ERα and ERβ was measured using Estrogen Receptor Competitor Assays from Invitrogen (PanVera) (Part # P2614, P2698 for ERα; Part # P2615, P2700 for ERβ) according to the manufacturer's instructions."," Estrogen Receptors (ERs) are hormone dependent transcription factors

Gac,2744,23708134,3719553," The antibiotic biosynthesis of M18 is coordinately controlled by multiple distinct regulatory pathways, of which the GacS/GacA system activates Plt biosynthesis but strongly downregulates PCA biosynthesis.;  Most secondary metabolic gene clusters, such as pvd, pch, plt, amb, and hcn, were activated by GacA.;  The GacA regulon also included genes encoding extracellular enzymes and cytochrome oxidases.;  Interestingly, the primary metabolism involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources was also notably regulated by GacA.;  Another important category of the GacA regulon was secretion systems, including H1, H2, and H3 (type VI secretion systems [T6SSs]), Hxc (T2SS), and Has and Apr (T1SSs), and CupE and Tad pili.;  More remarkably, GacA inhibited swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities.;  Taken together, the Gac-initiated global regulation, which was mostly mediated through multiple regulatory systems or factors, was mainly involved in secondary and primary metabolism, secretion systems, motility, etc., contributing to ecological or nutritional competence, ion homeostasis, and biocontrol in M18.;  Apart from the different and strong transcriptional regulation from all three P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) systems (Las, Rhl, and PQS) (11, 12, 15), antibiotic biosynthesis in the M18 strain is also subject to posttranscriptional regulation from the sRNA chaperone Hfq (16) and the Gac/Rsm signal transduction cascade (10, 17).; The well-known Gac/Rsm cascade has been characterized in detail in P. fluorescens CHA0 (18–20).;  The Gac/Rsm cascade is initiated by the Gac two-component regulatory system composed of the sensor kinase GacS and its corresponding response regulator, GacA.;  The GacS kinase responds to and senses an unidentified signal, causing the activation of the transcriptional regulator GacA through a phosphorelay mechanism.;  The active form of the GacA protein subsequently activates the transcription of the small RNAs (sRNAs) rsmXYZ.;  The modes of Gac system regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in M18 are both similar to and different from those in CHA0.;  Plt biosynthesis and its gene expression need activation by both the GacS/GacA global regulatory system (10) and the plt pathway-specific transcriptional activator PltR (21, 22).;  Moreover, one section of the activating pathway driven by Gac may be mediated by PltR (13).;  Intriguingly, the Gac system exerts strong downregulation on PCA biosynthesis through an uncharacterized mechanism (10).;  The Gac system also acts exclusively by controlling the transcription of sRNAs, RsmY, and RsmZ in P. aeruginosa PAK (24).;  The Gac/Rsm cascade covers a broad range of complex regulons regulating secondary metabolism and virulence factors.; During the long-term adaptation to rhizosphere environmental pressure, P. aeruginosa strain M18 may have evolved a unique set of secondary metabolic profiles involved in antibiotic biosynthesis and numerous corresponding global regulatory mechanisms, including Gac/Rsm (10, 17) and QS (11, 12, 15).;  The complex and diverse regulatory mechanisms of the Gac system in M18 urged us to analyze the global pattern of genomic expression of the gacA mutant and to further explore the importance of the Gac system to overall physiology and metabolism and the regulatory network of the Gac system.;  The results highlight a broader and more distinct regulatory profile of the GacS/GacA system in M18 than in Pf-5 and PAK.;  The Gac-controlled genotypic and phenotypic profiles predominantly included the secondary metabolism involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and extracellular enzymes as well as the primary metabolism involved in utilization of sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen, a large number of secretion systems, three types of motility, multiple regulatory factors or systems, etc.; The regulatory effect of GacA on three type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) was assessed by selecting hsiA1, hsiA2, and hsiB3, which correspond to the first genes of the hsiA1-hcp1, hsiA2-icmF2, and hsiB3-clpV3 operons located within the H1, H2, and H3 (T6SS) loci, respectively, in constructing the lacZ translational fusions in the pME6015 vector.; DNA microarray experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of GacA on the genome-wide transcription of P. aeruginosa M18.;  The transcriptome results were also confirmed by our previous report that the GacS/GacA two-component system (TCS) activated Plt biosynthesis and its operon expression and exerted strong downregulation on PCA biosynthesis and phz operon expression in M18 (10).;  The GacA regulon genes were grouped into 20 functional categories on the basis of PseudoCAP and were plotted with respect to downregulation and upregulation (Fig. 1A).;  The regulon under the positive control of GacA was mainly involved in secondary metabolism (51 genes), secretion systems (66 genes), cell membrane biogenesis (38 genes), etc.;  However, the negative regulon of GacA was predominantly involved in transcription factors and regulators (40 genes), amino acid transport and metabolism (34 genes), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (45 genes), etc. (Fig. 1A).; The well-characterized genes or gene clusters under GacA control are plotted in Fig. 1B.;  The secondary metabolic genes or gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of antibiotics (PCA, Plt, HCN, and AMB), siderophores (pyoverdine and pyochelin), and exoenzymes (alkaline protease, phospholipase C, chitinase, etc.) were strongly controlled by the Gac system.;  Surprisingly, the Gac system also exerted a significant influence on the primary metabolism involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus (phn, pst, and phoBR), sulfur (tau and ssu), and nitrogen (nor and nir).;  Many bacterial secretion systems also received strong and comprehensive regulation originating from GacA, including all three T6SSs (H1, H2, and H3), one T2SS (Hxc), two T1SSs (Has and Apr), one type I pilus system (CupE), and one type IVb pilus system (Tad).;  Among the genes in the GacA regulon, multiple operons encoding siderophores (pvd and pch) and hemophore (has) as well as phosphorus utilization operons (phn and pst) were established to play important roles in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis (36).;  The che2 chemotaxis operon (PAM18_0169 to PAM18_0178) was also shown to be subject to the positive control of GacA.;  Another important functional category occupying a large proportion of the GacA regulon was regulatory genes, such as two-component regulatory systems, transcriptional regulators, sigma factors, and regulators.;  This finding indicates that most members of the GacA regulon are likely under the indirect control of the Gac system.; In addition to plt and phz, the amb (PAM18_2734 to PAM18_2739) and hcn (PAM18_2842 to PAM18_2840) operons responsible for AMB and HCN biosyntheses, respectively, were also present among the positive regulons of GacA (Fig. 2E and ​andF).F).;  The Gac-initiated activation pathway of hcn expression was utilized as a classic model for clarifying the molecular regulatory mechanism of the Gac/Rsm cascade in CHA0 (20, 37).;  The expression of a functionally unknown gene cluster spanning from PAM18_1637 to PAM18_1629, which may be involved in secondary metabolism, was strongly positively regulated by GacA.;  These results indicate that the Gac system positively influences the biosynthesis of the siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin in M18, which is the opposite of the influence in P. protegens Pf-5 (23).; In addition to the antibiotic and siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters under GacA control, the expression of genes encoding some extracellular enzymes was also subject to Gac regulation.;  The Gac system regulated apr expression in the opposite directions between P. aeruginosa M18 and P. protegens Pf-5.; The GacS/GacA system is considered a master regulator of Pseudomonas secondary metabolism.;  Five compounds, including MgSO4, methionine, cysteine, SDS, and taurine, were used as the sole source of sulfur in assessing the influence of GacA on the sulfur utilization capacity of P. aeruginosa M18.;  These results, together with the transcriptome data, indicate that the primary metabolism involved in the uptake or catabolism of phosphonate, sulfonate, and nitrate compounds is also under the global regulation of the M18 Gac system.;  The control of primary metabolism by the Gac system may ultimately contribute to nutritional competition and ion homeostasis in P. aeruginosa M18.;  Among the T6SS regulons of GacA, the most significant downregulation at the transcript level was observed on the hcp genes encoding the secreted factor Hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein), including hcp1, hcp2, hcp3, hcpB, and hcpC (Fig. 6A to ​toD).D).;  These results clearly suggest that the Gac system positively controls the expression of T6SSs in P. aeruginosa M18.;  These results suggest that the Gac system positively controls the expression of the Has T1SS.;  In contrast, another T1SS (Apr) involved in alkaline protease secretion (44) was under the negative control of GacA (Fig. 2H).;  The downstream vreAIR operon encoding a cell surface signaling (CSS) system (46) was also strongly downregulated by GacA (Fig. 6F).;  The microarray result showed that the flp-rcp-tad locus was positively regulated by GacA (Fig. 6H).;  We measured the swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities of the gacA mutant and its parental strain, M18, in semisolid or soft agar to assess the influence of GacA on the motility of P. aeruginosa M18.;  Unexpectedly, among the GacA regulons of M18, no entire or partial motility-related gene clusters were negatively regulated by GacA.;  In contrast, gene clusters potentially related to bacterial motility, such as che2, were positively controlled by GacA.;  These results imply that the Gac system negatively controls the motility of P. aeruginosa M18 through a series of indirect and complex pathways or mechanisms.; The transcriptome profile revealed that 103 genes in the GacA regulon encode regulatory systems or factors, including 46 transcriptional regulators belonging to different families; 39 TCS elements; 15 sigma factors (RpoS, etc.), anti-sigma factors (VreR and FoxR), or sigma activators (Sfa2 and Sfa3); and 3 QS regulators (LasI, RsaL, and QscR).;  Among the TCSs regulated by GacA, PhoB/PhoR, NtrC/NtrB, PirS/PirR, and PAM18_2081/PAM18_2082 were significantly upregulated at the transcript level in the gacA mutant compared with their expression in wild-type strain M18.;  The sensor kinase-response regulator hybrid RetS, which is involved in the regulation of secretion system expression, exopolysaccharide production, and biofilm formation (51), was also positively regulated by GacA in M18.; In addition to TCSs, multiple CSS systems constituted a larger group of the GacA regulon, such as VreI-VreR-VreA, which upregulates the expression of the Hxc T2SS (46), FoxI-FoxR-FoxA (52), and two CSS-related systems, TonB2-ExbB1-ExbD1 and TonB4-ExbD2-ExbB2.;  In the transcriptome profile of M18, the largest family of transcriptional regulators under the control of GacA is the LysR family, which includes 11 genes.;  For example, the redox-sensitive transcriptional activator SoxR, a member of the MerR family, was negatively controlled by GacA.; The presence of multiple regulators within the GacA regulon implies that, in most cases, the GacS-GacA system may indirectly regulate various cellular processes and functions (e.g., bacterial metabolism, secretion systems, and motility) in M18 through the mediation of these regulatory systems or factors.;  Most of the above-mentioned regulators controlled by GacA in M18 are involved in the global or pathway-specific regulation of the Gac-controlled phenotypes in other Pseudomonas strains.;  Most GacA-regulated gene clusters include or link with one or more regulatory genes, such as pch (pchR) (Fig. 2B), phz2 (qscR) (Fig. 2D), plt (pltR) (Fig. 2C), pst (pstU and PAM18_5484) (Fig. 4B), phn (phnF) (Fig. 4A), the H1 T6SS (ppkA-pppA) (Fig. 6A), the H2 T6SS (stk1-stp1 and sfa2) (Fig. 6B), and the H3 T6SS (sfa3) (Fig. 6C).; The conserved Gac-Rsm signal transduction pathway, which is constituted by the two-component regulatory system GacS/GacA (BarA/UvrY in E. coli), the small RNAs RsmYZ (CsrB), and the translational repressor RsmA (CsrA), is typically involved in the regulation of virulence or biocontrol factors and carbon storage in many gammaproteobacteria (53).;  A general model of GacA-mediated global regulation in P. aeruginosa M18 is outlined in Fig. 9.;  The GacS/GacA system plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of diverse metabolic and physiological functions in the rhizobacterium P. aeruginosa M18, including secondary metabolism (involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, exoproducts, and siderophores), primary metabolism (involved in the assimilation and metabolism of phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources), ion homeostasis, ecological or nutritional competition, secretion systems, and cell motility (Fig. 9).;  The global transcriptional regulation driven by GacA is mostly mediated by many global or pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory systems or factors accounting for over 12% of all GacA regulons, such as transcriptional regulatory proteins of diverse families, TCSs, sigma factors or regulators, CSS systems, and QS systems.;  The Gac cascade, together with these regulatory systems and factors, is integrated into a cascaded and interwoven network to regulate globally a broad range of cell functions in M18.; General model of GacA-mediated global regulation in P. aeruginosa M18.;  The GacS/GacA two-component system, directly or indirectly through a large number of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulatory systems or factors, controls multiple sets of diverse biological processes, mainly including secondary metabolism, primary metabolism, bacterial secretion, and motility.;  Such culture conditions and such a sampling time were initially chosen for transcriptome profiling on the basis of the established viewpoint that the Gac system is a master regulatory system for Pseudomonas secondary metabolism (19).;  The transcriptome profile of P. protegens Pf-5 revealed that GacA significantly influenced the transcript levels of 635 genes.;  Three gene clusters, those for Plt, HCN, and H1 T6SS, are under the positive control of GacA in both strains (23).;  However, two siderophore gene clusters, pch and pvd, are positively regulated in M18 and negatively regulated in Pf-5 by GacA.;  In addition, a number of cytochrome c (cco) and o (cyo) oxidase genes involved in energy metabolism were under the similar control of GacA in both Pf-5 and M18.;  Apart from these common GacA regulons, in M18 a more extensive list of GacA regulons is involved in bacterial secretion (the H2 T6SS, H3 T6SS, Hxc T2SS, type I pilus CupE, and type IVb pilus Tad), secondary metabolism (amb and phz), and primary metabolism (phn, pst, ssu, tau, nir, and nor).; The transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAK revealed that 116 genes are positively controlled and 55 genes are negatively regulated (fold change, >2; P < 0.05) by GacA (24).;  Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of P. aeruginosa M18 and PAK revealed that 54 genes of the GacA regulon are under the common positive regulation of GacA in both strains (see Table S5 in the supplemental material).;  These GacA regulons with positive regulation include some genes of the H1 T6SS and H3 T6SS; the cat gene (PAM18_4330), encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; the sodM gene (PAM18_4559), encoding superoxide dismutase; etc. (24).;  However, only two genes and four genes were, respectively, commonly downregulated and reversely regulated by GacA in both strains (see Table S5 in the supplemental material).;  In the PAK strain, the Gac system negatively controls the type III secretion system, which is encoded by the genes psc, pcr, exs, and pop, and the pyrroloquinoline quinone genes pqqABCDE (24).; Typically, the GacS/GacA TCS plays an important role in the transition from primary to secondary metabolism and the control of the production of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes involved in biocontrol or pathogenicity and ecological fitness or competition (19, 53).;  This study shows that the Gac system regulates not only the secondary metabolism involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, siderophores, and extracellular enzymes but also the primary metabolism involved in the transport and metabolism of phosphate, sulfonate, and nitrogen compounds in P. aeruginosa M18.;  This observation implies another important function of the Gac system in ion homeostasis and the nutritional starvation response.;  For example, the PhoR/PhoB TCS, which is negatively controlled by the Gac system in M18, globally regulates the expression of phn, pst, phoBR, and other pho regulons in bacteria.;  All three modes of bacterial motility are repressed by the Gac system in M18.;  Instead, the motility-related che2 chemotaxis operon (54) was shown to be positively regulated by GacA in M18.;  Only a few individual motility-related genes, such as the two-component sensor gene fleS, the flagellar gene fliS, and the monorhamnolipid biosynthetic operon rhlAB, were shown to be under the negative regulation of GacA.;  In agreement with the negative control of M18 swarming motility by GacA, RsmA, as a downstream element of the Gac/Rsm cascade, positively controls the swarming ability of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (55).;  The GacS/GacA TCS in P. fluorescens F113 represses swimming motility via the KinB/AlgB TCS (56).;  However, it remains unknown whether the Gac system represses motility through KinB/AlgB in M18.;  In contrast to the Gac repression of F113 motility, the gacA mutant almost entirely impairs the swarming motility but does not obviously influence the swimming motility of the rhizobacterium P. protegens Pf-5 (23).;  Therefore, further research is needed to clarify the molecular regulatory mechanism of the Gac system on the motility of P. aeruginosa M18.; In conclusion, the GacS/GacA two-component system of P. aeruginosa M18 globally controls multiple sets of diverse biological processes, including secondary metabolism, primary metabolism, bacterial secretion, and motility, which contribute to ecological fitness or competence, ion homeostasis and nutritional competence, biocontrol or pathogenesis, etc.;  The P. aeruginosa PAK Gac system exerts direct transcriptional control only on the expression of sRNAs RsmYZ and thus posttranscriptionally regulates many relevant target genes or gene clusters.;  However, in M18, it remains unknown whether all GacA regulons involved in structural and regulatory functions are exclusively regulated via the Gac/Rsm cascade, composed of three different components, the GacS/GacA two-component system, the sRNAs RsmY and RsmZ, and the RNA-binding repressor RsmA.;  Identification and characterization of more direct target genes of each component in the Gac/Rsm system and their downstream key regulators should be conducted through the use of high-throughput technologies, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology, RNA sequencing, and interactomic techniques, to distinguish the Gac/Rsm-derived direct regulatory pathways from indirect pathways.;  Therefore, further research is needed to understand the complex regulatory pathways and networks that are commonly made up from the Gac/Rsm cascade and other global or pathway-specific regulatory systems or factors, such as other TCSs, QSs, CSSs, sRNAs, transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulators of different families, etc.",
GcvT,275,28784988,5547118," Further characterization of several other berberine-utilizing bacteria and the genes encoding key demethylenation enzymes revealed that these enzymes are tetrahydrofolate dependent and similar to demethylation enzymes such as GcvT.; The amino acid sequence of CDS6194 has 44–50% identity with the T-protein of the glycine cleavage system (GcvT), which is expected to function as a THF-dependent aminomethyltransferase in various bacteria (Supplementary Table 1).;  Interestingly, BrdA proteins of these BBR-degrading bacteria are similar to the THF-dependent GcvT protein of various bacteria.;  Among the THF-dependent GcvT homologous enzymes, only four enzymes (SesA from Sinomonas sp. no. 22, DesA and LigM from Sphingobium paucimobilis SYK-6 and DmdA from Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062) have been characterized.; In this study, we demonstrated that four species of BBR-degrading bacteria (two Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria) harbor enzymes that cleave the methylenedioxy ring of BBR; these enzymes are similar to GcvT, the THF-dependent demethylenase that is involved in glycine metabolism.;  By contrast, bacteria that have evolved to utilize BBR might have developed GcvT-like enzymes for demethylation and demethylenation without oxidation."," The amino acid sequence of CDS6194 has 44–50% identity with the

IF1,93974,15755955,1082788," Subsequent sections describe the structure, function, and interactions of the mRNA, the initiator tRNA, and the initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3.;  Translation initiation is promoted by IF1, IF2, and IF3, which mediate base pairing of the initiator tRNA anticodon to the mRNA initiation codon located in the ribosomal P-site.;  The ribosome, the aminoacylated and formylated initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNAfMet), mRNA, and the three protein factors, initiation factor IF1, initiation factor IF2, and initiation factor IF3, are involved in the translation initiation phase (Fig. ​(Fig.11).;  Translation initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3, the mRNA, and the fMet-tRNAfMet are shown in red, blue, green, yellow, and magenta, respectively.;  Structures are derived from PDB entries as follows: 30S ribosomal subunit, 1HR0; 50S ribosomal subunit, 1FFK; IF1, 1HR0; IF2, 1G7T; IF3N, 1TIF; IF3C, 1TIG; mRNA, 1JGQ; fMet-tRNAfMet, 1JGQ.;  Initiation factor IF1 binds specifically to the base of the A-site of the 30S ribosomal subunit and is thought to direct the initiator tRNA to the ribosomal P-site by blocking the A-site (26, 41).;  IF1 stimulates the activities of IF3 and hence also the dissociation of the ribosomal subunits (63).;  Initiation factors IF1 and IF3 are ejected, while IF2 stimulates association of the 50S ribosomal subunit to the complex.;  However, site-directed cross-linking experiments have shown that mRNA is partially relocated on the 30S ribosomal subunit from a “standby site” to a site closer to the P-site in a process influenced by IF1, IF2, and especially IF3 (101).; Initiation factor IF1 is the smallest of the three bacterial translation initiation factors with a molecular mass of 8.2 kDa in E. coli.;  IF1 is encoded by the infA gene.;  Proteins with IF1-like structure and function are present in all three phylogenetic domains.;  The archaeal and eukaryotic homologues are referred to as aIF1A and eIF1A, respectively (98, 209).;  One model suggests that the bacterial initiation factors evolved from an ancestral IF1-type protein through consecutive duplication and fusion events (35).; The structure of IF1 in solution has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (204).;  IF1 belongs to the family of oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold proteins.;  Structures of the archaeal and eukaryotic IF1 homologues (aIF1A and eIF1A) have also been determined (6, 111).; Initiation factor IF1 and structural homologues. (A) Structures of IF1 and homologues: IF1 from E. coli (PDB entry 1AH9); human eIF1A, residues 40 to 125 (PDB entry 1D7Q); aIF1A from Methanococcus jannaschii (PDB entry 1JT8); and cold shock protein A (CspA) from E. coli (PDB entry 1MJC). eIF1A and aIF1A have an additional helix located at the C terminus. (B) Sequence alignment of selected IF1 sequences.;  It has been shown that the cellular defects resulting from a double deletion in the genes encoding cold shock proteins CspB and CspC in Bacillus subtilis can be complemented by heterologous expression of E. coli IF1 (244).;  This confirms the structural resemblance and functionality between IF1 and the cold shock proteins.; The binding of IF1 to the 30S ribosomal subunit has been extensively mapped.;  IF1 binds in a cleft between the 530 loop and helix 44 of 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein S12 (Fig. ​(Fig.8).8).;  Cleavage of 16S rRNA with cloacin DF13 between A1493 and A1494, two positions located in the 30S ribosomal A-site, specifically disrupts the function of IF1 (2a).;  Binding of IF1 to the 30S ribosomal subunit protects A1492 and A1493 from modification by dimethyl sulfate and protects G530 from attack by kethoxal (132).;  These positions are protected by A-site-bound tRNA, strongly supporting the notion that IF1 is located at an overlapping binding site.;  Mutational analysis demonstrated that the C1408-G1494 base pair and the three adenosines A1408, A1492, and A1493 are required for optimal IF1 binding, and it appeared that the internal loop of helix 44 is more important for IF1 binding than the identity of the nucleotide present at a certain position in the interacting part of helix 44 (41).; IF1 bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit. (A) Structure of IF1 on the 30S ribosomal subunit.;  IF1 is shown in blue, helix 44 is shown in magenta, the 530 loop is shown in yellow, and protein S12 is shown in green.;  The structure is derived from PDB entry 1HR0. (B) Close-up of the interaction of IF1 with the 30S subunit.;  IF1 is shown in a surface representation colored according to the electrostatic potential (positive charges, blue; negative charges, red).;  Note that they have flipped out of helix 44 and are buried in a pocket in IF1 and a pocket between IF1 and S12, respectively.; The structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit from T. thermophilus in complex with IF1 agrees well with most biochemical and mutagenesis data.;  A1492 and A1493 are buried in the part of the IF1 surface responsible for 16S rRNA interaction.;  A number of amino acids crucial for IF1 function were identified by site-directed mutagenesis (37, 65, 216).;  Moreover, specific signal changes in NMR spectroscopy experiments on titration of IF1 with 30S ribosomal subunits have been used to identify positions on IF1 involved in the interaction (204) (Fig. ​(Fig.8).8).;  As IF1 binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, it inserts the loop containing residues 17 to 25 into helix 44 and thereby flips out the bases A1492 and A1493 (Fig. ​(Fig.8).8).;  IF1 binding alters the reactivity of sites in 16S rRNA protected by tRNA, 50S ribosomal subunits, or aminoglycoside antibiotics (41).; Several functions have been attributed to bacterial IF1.;  Interaction between IF2 and the 30S ribosomal subunit is favored when IF1 is bound, and the release of IF2 is indirectly promoted when IF1 is ejected (27, 136, 222).;  IF1 cooperates with IF2 to ensure that only the initiator tRNA binds to the P-site and that it interacts with the initiation codon of the mRNA (24, 73, 127, 251).;  IF1 occlude tRNAs from the A-site until the 70S initiation complex has formed.;  Ejection of IF1 consequently opens the A-site for incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs.;  In vivo studies have shown that IF1-depleted cells have low growth rates and short polysomes (39).;  These data demonstrate that IF1 is essential for cell viability and suggest that one or more of its functions are crucial.; Early cross-linking experiments show that parts of IF1 and IF2 are in close proximity on the ribosome (13).;  Interactions between the eukaryotic homologues eIF5B and eIF1A have been mapped by using the yeast two-hybrid system, coimmunoprecipitation, in vitro binding assays, and NMR spectroscopy (31, 120, 159).;  The C-terminal unstructured region of eIF1A, which is not present in bacterial IF1, interacts with the C terminus of eIF5B.;  Domain V of bacterial IF2 was suggested to interact with IF1 on the ribosome (120, 136).;  Models in which IF2 and IF1 in concert mimic the anticodon loop, anticodon stem, D-loop, and D-stem of A-site-bound tRNA have been suggested (17, 138).;  The new structural knowledge and recent biochemical data reveal that the macromolecular mimicry model for IF2 and IF1 is inaccurate.; IF2 has been cross-linked to S13, L7-L12, IF1, and IF3 (13), as well as S1, S2, S11, S12, and S19 on the ribosome (14).;  These footprints were generated regardless of the presence of GTP, IF1, mRNA, and fMet-tRNAfMet.;  Whereas IF1 and IF2 are universally present and important for the function of all living cells, IF3 is limited to a number of bacterial species and has been found in some plastids (112, 254, 255).",
IF2,9669,15755955,1082788," Subsequent sections describe the structure, function, and interactions of the mRNA, the initiator tRNA, and the initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3.;  Translation initiation is promoted by IF1, IF2, and IF3, which mediate base pairing of the initiator tRNA anticodon to the mRNA initiation codon located in the ribosomal P-site.;  The ribosome, the aminoacylated and formylated initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNAfMet), mRNA, and the three protein factors, initiation factor IF1, initiation factor IF2, and initiation factor IF3, are involved in the translation initiation phase (Fig. ​(Fig.11).;  Translation initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3, the mRNA, and the fMet-tRNAfMet are shown in red, blue, green, yellow, and magenta, respectively.;  Structures are derived from PDB entries as follows: 30S ribosomal subunit, 1HR0; 50S ribosomal subunit, 1FFK; IF1, 1HR0; IF2, 1G7T; IF3N, 1TIF; IF3C, 1TIG; mRNA, 1JGQ; fMet-tRNAfMet, 1JGQ.; Following subunit dissociation, IF2, mRNA, and fMet-tRNAfMet associate with the 30S ribosomal subunit in an unknown and possibly random order.;  All three steps are probably promoted by IF2, which interacts with fMet-tRNAfMet on the ribosome.;  Initiation factors IF1 and IF3 are ejected, while IF2 stimulates association of the 50S ribosomal subunit to the complex.;  Initiator fMet-tRNAfMet is adjusted to the correct position in the P-site, and IF2 is released from the complex.;  During this process, GTP bound to IF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi.;  However, site-directed cross-linking experiments have shown that mRNA is partially relocated on the 30S ribosomal subunit from a “standby site” to a site closer to the P-site in a process influenced by IF1, IF2, and especially IF3 (101).;  IF2 stimulates the binding of leaderless mRNAs, presumably by recruitment of fMet-tRNAfMet to the subunit.;  Studies with E. coli revealed that the ratio of IF2 to IF3 plays an important role in translation initiation of leaderless mRNAs.;  It was suggested that leaderless mRNA is recognized by a 30S-IF2-fMet-tRNAfMet complex equivalent to that formed during translation initiation in eukaryotes (Fig. ​(Fig.3)3) (57, 58, 227).;  This was based on the finding that an increase in the concentration of IF2 enhances the efficiency of leaderless mRNA translation, possibly by recruitment of fMet-tRNAfMet to 30S ribosomal subunits, thus enabling codon-anticodon interaction.; Formylation favors selection of the fMet-tRNAfMet by IF2 (223), and blocks binding to the elongation factor EF1A and thus the function as elongator tRNA (71, 147, 202).;  The nature of the amino acid attached to the tRNA is less important for IF2 binding than is formylation.;  Hence, IF2 is able to bind to fVal-tRNA and fGln-tRNA but not to the unformylated tRNAs (251).;  However, moderate overexpression of IF2 leads to translation initiation without formylation of Met-tRNAfMet, and IF2 stimulates the binding of unformylated Met-tRNAfMet to 30S ribosomal subunits in vitro (68, 250).; IF2 protects the ester bond in fMet-tRNAfMet against spontaneous hydrolysis but does not protect the unformylated Met-tRNAfMet (167).;  Discrimination by IF2 against the unformylated Met-tRNAfMet has also been demonstrated by footprinting experiments performed with Met-tRNAfMet and fMet-tRNAfMet in the presence of IF2.;  The experiments indicate binding of IF2 to the acceptor stem, position 12 to 13 in the D-stem, two sites in the anticodon stem, and parts of the T-loop and the minor groove of the fMet-tRNAfMet T-stem (Fig. ​(Fig.6)6) (166, 243).;  Based on a similar cleavage pattern of RNase VI in the anticodon stem of Met-tRNAfMet bound to MTF, it was proposed that the interaction between fMet-tRNAfMet and IF2 induces a conformational change in the anticodon stem (122).; Original proposals suggested that IF2 carries fMet-tRNAfMet to the ribosome by analogy to EF1A for aminoacyl-tRNAs and eIF2 for Met-tRNAiMet (reviewed in reference 94).;  A specific binary complex can be formed between fMet-tRNAfMet and IF2 in vitro, but the interaction is weak, with a Kd of 1.8 μM, and the complex dissociates readily in the presence of magnesium ions (113, 118, 119, 167, 251).;  Most evidence suggests that IF2 performs its interactions with fMet-tRNAfMet on the 30S ribosomal subunit (251).;  Two promoters control the transcription of the E. coli gene as monocistronic mRNAs, both ending at the same transcriptional terminator. infA transcription is not physically linked to any other genes as are infB and infC (the genes encoding IF2 and IF3) (40).; The OB fold proteins include RNA binding proteins such as ribosomal protein S1, the cold shock proteins CspA and CspB (20), domain II of eIF5A (91), eIF2α (151), and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (187).;  It enhances the dissociation and association rate for 70S ribosomes (46, 59), primarily through the stimulating effect on the activity of IF2 and IF3 (174).;  Interaction between IF2 and the 30S ribosomal subunit is favored when IF1 is bound, and the release of IF2 is indirectly promoted when IF1 is ejected (27, 136, 222).;  IF1 cooperates with IF2 to ensure that only the initiator tRNA binds to the P-site and that it interacts with the initiation codon of the mRNA (24, 73, 127, 251).; IF2 is the largest of the initiation factors.;  The infB gene is part of the polycistronic nusA operon containing metY (minor form of the initiator tRNA), ylxC (protein of unknown function), nusA (a transcriptional termination factor), infB (translation initiation factor IF2), rbfA (ribosome binding factor A), truB (tRNA pseudouridine 5S synthase), rpsO (ribosomal protein S15), and pnp (polynucleotide phosphorylase).; Three isoforms of the initiation factor, named IF2-1 (97.3 kDa), IF2-2 (79.7 kDa), and IF2-3 (78.8 kDa), exist in E. coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (107, 154).;  Bacillus subtilis is the only organism that does not belong to the Enterobacteriaceae where more than one isoform of IF2 has been experimentally demonstrated (81).;  IF2-1, IF2-2, and IF2-3 are translated from three independent but in-frame translational start sites of the infB mRNA.;  Hence, IF2-2 and IF2-3 differ from IF2-1 only by the absence of the first 157 and 164 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. ​(Fig.9)9) (139).;  The cellular content of IF2-2 and IF2-3 is close to the level of IF2-1 at optimal growth conditions (79, 191), but the ratio of IF2-2 and IF2-3 to IF2-1 increases as a response to cold shock (53).;  We suggest that this structure is required for the translation of IF2-2 and IF2-3 (107).; IF2 and structural homologues. (A) Schematic representation of the E. coli IF2 primary structure.;  The domain boundaries and the lengths of the three IF2 isoforms are indicated.;  Ribbon diagrams of the structures of the IF2N domain from E. coli (PDB entry 1ND9) and the IF2 homologue aIF5B from M. thermoautotrophicum (PDB entry 1G7T) are shown.;  The domains are indicated in different colors, and the E. coli domain nomenclature is used. (B) Sequence alignment of selected bacterial IF2 and archaeal and eukaryotic homologues.; IF2 can be divided into domains based on interspecies homology.;  Homologues of IF2 have been found in archaeabacteria and eukaryotes, where the factor is referred to as aIF5B and eIF5B, respectively (98).;  The homologues have functions similar to those of bacterial IF2, including GTPase activity, promotion of ribosomal subunit association, and probably interaction with the initiator tRNA (30, 165).; No direct tertiary-structure information is available for domains IV to VI of E. coli IF2, but the structure of the homologous protein aIF5B from the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has been solved (Fig. ​(Fig.9)9) (185).;  Amino acid sequence homology predicts a similar structure for domains IV to VI of bacterial IF2, although there are two additional helical segments at the C-terminus of the archaeal factor (Fig. ​(Fig.99).;  Overall homology among bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeabacterial IF2, eIF5B, and aIF5B is highest in the G-domain area of the factor (Fig. ​(Fig.9).9).;  The structure of the C-terminal domain of Bacillus stearothermophilus IF2 has been solved by NMR spectroscopy methods (128).; In contrast to the C-terminal region, the N-terminal region of IF2 is highly variable in both primary structure and length.;  The region can be divided into three separate domains in E. coli IF2 based on sequence and biochemical data (Fig. ​(Fig.9)9) (140).;  Domain I contains a small subdomain of approximately 50 residues, found in all bacterial and some plastid IF2s.;  The subdomain is now designated IF2N in the protein families database (PFAM).;  IF2N has homology to the stem contact fold domains of the methionyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases and the B5 domain of the phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase.;  However, no specific function has been assigned to the IF2N domain (105).;  NMR spectroscopy of the full-length E. coli IF2-1 revealed that the IF2N domain is connected to domain IV by a highly flexible linker region (104).; Macromolecular interactions of the domains in the N-terminal region of IF2 has been demonstrated only in E. coli, where a fragment consisting of the combined domains I and II, but not a fragment of isolated domain I, binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit (136, 137).;  Furthermore, we have identified domains I and II of E. coli IF2 as an interaction partner for the infB mRNA (107).; B. stearothermophilus and T. thermophilus IF2 possess a single domain in the region N-terminal to the G-domain, whereas myxobacterial IF2, which has the longest N-terminal regions characterized in bacteria, is composed of several domains with a highly unusual amino acid composition.;  The latter is a general feature of the N-terminal regions of IF2 (16, 64, 225, 230).;  Regions N-terminal to the G-domain of eukaryotic IF2 homologues are generally long, up to ∼700 amino acids, whereas the regions of the archaeal IF2 homologues are generally short.;  Conclusively, the functional importance of the N-terminal region of IF2 and its homologues remains unresolved.; The role of the GTPase activity of IF2 has been a matter of debate for decades.; Elongation factor EF1A associates approximately 100-fold more strongly with GDP than with GTP, whereas IF2 associates only 10-fold more strongly with GDP (163, 175).;  A guanine nucleotide exchange factor may therefore not be required for IF2 as in the case of EF1A, where nucleotide exchange involves the factor EF1B.;  Hydrolysis of GTP by IF2 depends on the presence of ribosomes, and the factor has no intrinsic GTPase activity by itself.;  However, B. stearothermophilus IF2 can hydrolyze GTP in the absence of ribosomes when 20% ethanol is included in the reaction mixture (64).;  GTP hydrolysis in translation initiation has been suggested to be important for the release of IF2 from the 70S initiation complex (108, 114), and for the adjustment of initiator tRNA in the ribosomal P-site (103).;  The crucial importance of GTP hydrolysis in translation initiation and its direct relation to cell viability have been confirmed by several studies of G-domain mutants of IF2 (98a, 100, 106, 115).; The G-domains of IF2 and EF1A are thought to have overlapping binding sites.;  Fluorescence stopped-flow experiments showed that binding of EF1A to ribosomes probed with IF2 was independent of the bound nucleotide.;  It was thus concluded that neither the ejection of IF2 from the ribosome nor its recycling requires GTP hydrolysis (102, 231).;  The conclusions from these experiments are that the GTP-bound form of IF2 accelerates association of the ribosomal subunits and that GTP hydrolysis accelerates ejection of IF2 from the 70S ribosome (2).; Early cross-linking experiments show that parts of IF1 and IF2 are in close proximity on the ribosome (13).;  The interaction between the two factors maps to a region between domains III and V of E. coli IF2 (136).;  Domain V of bacterial IF2 was suggested to interact with IF1 on the ribosome (120, 136).; As mentioned above, the interactions between fMet-tRNAfMet and IF2 have been studied extensively.;  The C-terminal domain VI-2 of IF2 has been suggested to contain the entire binding site for fMet-tRNAfMet (215).;  Finally, fMet-tRNAfMet protects a position in domain IV and weakly in domain V of B. stearothermophilus IF2 against digestion by trypsin (205).;  A stable interaction between the archaeal and eukaryotic IF2 homologues and Met-tRNAiMet has not been observed in vitro, but overexpression of the gene encoding tRNAiMet partially suppresses the severe slow-growth phenotype of yeast strains lacking the IF2 homologue (30).; IF2 Interactions with fMet-tRNAfMet and the ribosome. (A) The 30S ribosomal subunit from T. thermophilus (PDB entry 1J5E) in complex with a P-site fMet-tRNAfMet (derived and docked based on PDB entry 1GIX).;  The fMet-ACC region of the tRNA that interacts with the C-terminal region of IF2 is shown in red.;  Two residues in domain V of IF2 (V451 and S520 of B. stearothermophilus IF2) are shown in yellow and magenta, respectively.;  Note that these cleavages are absent in a 30S-IF2 initiation complex. (B) The 50S ribosomal subunit from H. marismortui (PDB entry 1JJ2) is shown along with aIF5B.;  Pale blue and light green on the subunit indicate two positions in helix 89 of the 23S rRNA (U2474 and A2482 in E. coli numbering) that are cleaved by nucleases attached at the residue located at the interface between domains VI-1 and VI-2 of IF2 (shown in dark green on the aIF5b structure) (E644 of the B. stearothermophilus IF2).;  A nuclease attached to a residue in domain VI-1 of IF2 (dark blue) (E632 of the B. stearothermophilus IF2) cleaves both the C1076 (cyan) and G1068 (cyan) positions in the L11 region.;  Another study showed that IF2 protects residues in the sarcin-ricin domain (SRD) (G2655, A2665, and G2661) against chemical modification (100).;  No attempt was made to dock IF2 on the ribosomal subunit, since it is likely that conformational changes occur in the subunit as a result of IF2 binding.; IF2 is the only one of the three initiation factors that displays a relatively high and specific affinity for both ribosomal subunits.;  However, structures of IF2 in complex with the ribosome or the fMet-tRNAfMet remain absent.;  Models in which IF2 and IF1 in concert mimic the anticodon loop, anticodon stem, D-loop, and D-stem of A-site-bound tRNA have been suggested (17, 138).;  However, these models were proposed prior to the elucidation of the structure of the IF2 homologue from M. thermoautotrophicum (185).;  The new structural knowledge and recent biochemical data reveal that the macromolecular mimicry model for IF2 and IF1 is inaccurate.;  EF1A, EF2, and IF2 all interact with the ribosome at the factor binding site (23, 131, 182).;  An additional constraint to place IF2 on the ribosome is the interaction with fMet-tRNAfMet, which places domain VI-2 of IF2 in proximity of the fMet-CCA end of the P-site-bound initiator tRNA.; IF2 has been cross-linked to S13, L7-L12, IF1, and IF3 (13), as well as S1, S2, S11, S12, and S19 on the ribosome (14).;  Chemical probing experiments with 23S rRNA indicated that IF2 protects A2476 and A2478 in helix 89 of domain V as well as G2655, A2660, G2661, and A2665 of the sarcin-ricin domain positioned in domain VI (Fig. ​(Fig.10)10) (102).;  Unfortunately, the results are unclear with respect to the 30S ribosomal subunit, since IF2 affects the reactivity of residues spread all over the subunit.;  This is consistent with an observed rearrangement of the subunit induced by IF2 (242).;  Recently, a model of IF2 binding to the ribosome was presented, based on cleavage of the rRNA by chemical nucleases tethered to cysteine residues introduced at specific sites of IF2 (121).;  No cleavage of the 16S rRNA was observed when IF2 was bound to 30S ribosomal subunits or to the complete 30S initiation complex.;  However, cleavage of the 16S rRNA was observed when IF2 was bound to the 70S initiation complex (Fig. ​(Fig.10).10).;  These data indicate that domain V of IF2 is localized toward the 30S subunit in the 70S initiation complex.;  As described above, cross-linking data of the 30S complex and footprinting data on the binary fMet-tRNAfMet-IF2 complex place domain V of IF2 in proximity to the elbow of the P-site-bound fMet-tRNAfMet.;  The distance between the 16S rRNA and the elbow of the fMet-tRNAfMet appears to be too far for domain V of IF2 to establish contact with both simultaneously.;  Conclusively, IF2 changes localization during the transition from the 30S to the 70S initiation complex (121).;  Large domain movements take place in IF2 during GTP hydrolysis (185), and the cleavage patterns in the rRNA might be dependent on whether IF2 is in the GTP- or GDP-bound form.;  To fully understand the function of IF2 during translation initiation, detailed atomic resolution structures of both the 30S and 70S initiation complexes as well as a better understanding of the timing and not least the consequences of GTP hydrolysis are needed.; Besides the function as a translation factor, IF2 has the properties of a chaperone.;  Furthermore, the expression of IF2 is upregulated during the cold shock response (3), and the factor is important for the translation of leaderless transcripts (57).;  Finally, we have introduced the use of IF2 sequence data for the classification of organisms of closely related organisms (75-77, 152, 209, 226).;  Whereas IF1 and IF2 are universally present and important for the function of all living cells, IF3 is limited to a number of bacterial species and has been found in some plastids (112, 254, 255).;  GTP levels have been proposed to be directly coupled to the activity of IF2, which is active only in the GTP-bound form (12). mRNA-mediated detection of environmental conditions has been reviewed previously (32, 153, 240).;  Expression from leaderless mRNAs is suppressed by IF3 and stimulated by IF2 (58).",

 Current studies, therefore, examined the potential role of probiotic Lactobacilli in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and counteracting EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function.;  Of the five species of Lactobacilli, short-term (3 h) treatment with L. acidophilus (LA) significantly increased MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells.;  Heat-killed LA was ineffective, whereas the conditioned culture supernatant of LA (LA-CS) was equally effective in stimulating MCT1 function, indicating that the effects are mediated by LA-secreted soluble factor(s).;  Furthermore, LA-CS increased apical membrane levels of MCT1 protein via decreasing its basal endocytosis, suggesting that LA-CS stimulation of butyrate uptake could be secondary to increased levels of MCT1 on the apical cell surface.;  LA-CS also attenuated EPEC inhibition of butyrate uptake and EPEC-mediated endocytosis of MCT1.;  Previous studies from our laboratory and others suggested monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1) to play a key role in mediating H+-coupled absorption of human colonic luminal butyrate (22, 33, 34).;  Various studies have also shown differential regulation of MCT1 to impact colonic epithelial health.;  In fact, downregulation of MCT1 expression and/or activity has been reported in mucosal inflammation (41, 42), colon cancer (12, 19), and in response to infection by enteropathogenic E. coli (4), an important human enteric pathogen causing infantile diarrhea.;  On the other hand, various studies showed upregulation of MCT1 expression and/or activity in response to various agents, such as luminal leptin (9), somatostatin (36), butyrate (7, 11), and via nutrient-sensing mechanisms (6).;  In this report, we have demonstrated upregulation of MCT1 activity by the bioactive soluble factors secreted by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) via increasing the levels of the transporter at the apical cell surface.;  These factors also alleviated enteropathogenic E. coli-induced inhibition of MCT1 activity.; Apical uptake of 14C-butyrate was measured as described previously (6), in the presence or absence of pCMBS, a specific inhibitor of MCT1.;  After immunoprecipitation of biotinylated antigens with neutravidin agarose, biotinylated proteins were released by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then probed with anti-MCT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).;  The surface MCT1 was compared with total cellular MCT1, as determined by immunoblotting of the solubilized cell extract.;  Cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for endocytosed MCT1, as described above.; In the initial set of studies, we used five species of Lactobacilli, as outlined in materials and methods, to examine their short-term treatment effects on MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake in postconfluent Caco-2 cell monolayers.; Short-term treatment with L. acidophilus (LA) and L. casei (LC) stimulates monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells.;  MCT1 function [p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate (pCMBS)-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake] was determined and calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.;  We have also determined LA-CS effects on MCT1 function in T-84 cells, another human intestinal epithelial cell line, and observed significant increase in pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake following LA-CS treatments for 3 h (in nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1: control, 1.62 ± 0.08 vs.;  These results suggest that LA-CS effects in stimulating MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake are not cell line specific.; Culture supernatant of LA, but not heat-killed bacteria, mimics the effects of live bacteria on MCT1 function: postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with live or heat-killed LA (overnight cultures diluted to 600-nm absorbance = 0.2), or bacteria-free culture supernatant of LA (LA-CS) (diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F-12).;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; To examine the mechanisms of butyrate enhancement of MCT1 function, we performed kinetic analysis of LA-CS effects on butyrate uptake.;  As shown in Table 1, LA-CS treatment caused significant increase in Vmax of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake and a decrease in Km.;  Increased Vmax could imply increased MCT1 levels at the cell surface, whereas decreased Km suggests increased affinity of MCT1 for the substrate.; We next utilized cell surface biotinylation to measure apical membrane levels of MCT1 in response to LA-CS treatments.;  Consistent with increased function, LA-CS treatment (3 h) significantly increased apical membrane MCT1 levels (Fig. 3A).;  To examine whether LA-CS-mediated increase in apical membrane MCT1 is via decreasing basal endocytosis of MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization assay to measure endocytosed MCT1 fraction in the presence or absence of LA-CS.;  As shown in Fig. 3B, LA-CS significantly decreased basal MCT1 endocytosis, suggesting that increased cell surface MCT1, at least partially, is due to decreased endocytosis in response to LA-CS treatments.; LA-CS increases apical surface MCT1 level via decreasing endocytic internalization.;  A: Caco-2 monolayers (14-day postplating) were treated with LA-CS for 3 h, and apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell surface biotinylation.;  B: following surface biotinylation, Caco-2 monolayers were incubated with LA-CS at 37°C for 3 h, and endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  EPEC infection for 30 min substantially inhibited MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake (Fig. 4), as was also shown in our previous studies (4).;  On the other hand, LA-CS also attenuated EPEC-induced inhibition of MCT1-mediated butyrate uptake.;  MCT1 function (pCMBS-sensitive 14C-butyrate uptake) was determined and calculated as nmol butyrate·mg protein−1·5 min−1.; Our earlier studies have shown that EPEC inhibition of butyrate uptake was associated with decreased MCT1 levels on the apical cell surface (4).;  Therefore, we examined whether LA-CS could counteract EPEC-induced internalization of surface MCT1.;  As shown in Fig. 5A, LA-CS alone increased the level of surface MCT1 and also blocked the EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1.; LA-CS attenuates EPEC-induced decrease in cell surface MCT1 via counteracting EPEC-induced MCT1 endocytosis.;  Apical membrane MCT1 levels were measured by cell-surface biotinylation.;  Top: the band intensities of apical vs. total MCT1 in different groups.;  Endocytosed MCT1 fractions were measured by reversible biotinylation, as described in materials and methods.;  Top: the band intensities of endocytosed vs. total MCT1 in different groups.; To examine the mechanisms of LA-CS alleviation of EPEC-induced decrease in surface MCT1, we performed endocytic internalization studies utilizing reversible biotinylation.;  As shown in Fig. 5B, EPEC infection increased the endocytosed fraction of MCT1 compared with control.;  LA-CS not only decreased basal endocytosis, but also counteracted EPEC-induced endocytosis of MCT1.;  In this regard, studies from our laboratory and others have shown MCT1 to play a major role in the absorption of colonic luminal butyrate (17, 22, 33, 34).;  Impaired butyrate absorption secondary to downregulation of MCT1 has been reported in inflammation (41, 42) and colon cancer (12, 19).;  We have also shown inhibition of MCT1 function in response to infection by EPEC (4), a food-borne pathogen causing early diarrhea, more particularly in children.;  Therefore, agents that upregulate MCT1 activity and/or correct MCT1 dysfunction could be of therapeutic value for intestinal inflammatory disorders associated with impaired butyrate absorption.;  In the present report, we have shown short-term effects of the probiotic LA in stimulating butyrate uptake in Caco-2 cells via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical membrane.;  Our laboratory's recent studies have also shown LP stimulation of Na+-coupled butyrate uptake in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells via upregulation of sodium-coupled MCT1 (SMCT1) expression (2).;  SMCT1 is a relatively recently characterized transport protein implicated in Na+-coupled transport of butyrate across colonic luminal membrane (21).;  Therefore, it seemed logical to us to investigate the effects of probiotic Lactobacilli species on MCT1 activity.;  Interestingly, LP showing long-term effects in increasing SMCT1 expression and function in IEC-6 cells, and mouse colon, as reported earlier (2), had no effects on MCT1 function.;  On the other hand, LA, another species of Lactobacilli, increased MCT1 function via increasing the level of MCT1 at the apical cell surface.;  Additionally, heat-killed LA did not affect MCT1 function, whereas bacteria-free LA-CS had the same stimulatory effects on MCT1 function as that of live LA, suggesting the role of LA-secreted soluble factors in mediating the beneficial effects on MCT1 function.;  LA-CS-induced activation of MCT1 function in polarized Caco-2 cells was kinetically manifested by increased Vmax and decreased Km.;  Increased Vmax suggests that LA-CS-induced increase in the absorptive capacity of MCT1 was due to its increased apical membrane abundance, which was also supported by our cell surface biotinylation studies.;  Endocytic internalization studies further suggested that increased apical membrane localization of MCT1 could, at least partially, be due to LA-CS inhibition of basal MCT1 endocytosis.;  The observed decrease in Km in response to LA-CS treatments could indicate increased affinity of MCT1 for butyrate.;  However, potential alternative mechanisms of LA-CS effects, such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MCT1, could also account for the observed effects on the Km.;  Furthermore, altered interactions of MCT1 with CD147, an auxillary glycoprotein known to play critical role in membrane targeting of MCT1 (26), need to be examined to account for LA-CS enhancement of apical membrane levels of MCT1.; Our results showed that LA-CS not only stimulates MCT1 function and membrane expression, but also counteracts EPEC inhibition of MCT1 function and EPEC-mediated endocytic internalization of MCT1 from apical cell surface.;  Since bacteria-free LA-CS itself could counteract EPEC inhibition of MCT1 activity and live LA was not required, the effects were presumably not due to pathogen exclusion, but rather via induction of signaling events that modulated MCT1 intracellular trafficking mechanisms.;  These and other relevant signaling events could also play important roles in mediating LA-CS effects on MCT1 endocytosis and recycling under basal conditions or in response to EPEC infection.;  Therefore, our studies showing positive effects of probiotic-secreted molecules on the functionality of MCT1, a major player in mediating cellular entry of luminally produced butyrate, have great implications in colonic epithelial health and integrity.",

NRP,8829,22802156,4807874,"Many pharmaceuticals on the market today belong to a large class of natural products called nonribosomal peptides (NRPs).;  The biosynthesis of these complex compounds is carried out by large multimodular megaenzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).;  Biochemical and bioinformatic investigations of these enzymes have uncovered the key principles of NRP synthesis, expanding the pharmaceutical potential of their enzymatic processes.;  This review focuses on the recent discoveries and breakthroughs in the structural elucidation, molecular mechanism, and chemical biology underlying the discrete domains within NRPSs.; Prominent among these microbial metabolites is the large subclass of natural products known as nonribosomal peptides (NRPs).;  These peptide-based natural products are synthesized by large multifunctional megaproteins called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).3 The structural framework of these biosynthetic enzymes are comprised of modules that are responsible for the incorporation of a single building block into the natural product.;  The modules can be organized on a single polypetide (type I NRPS), as seen in many fungal species,4,5 or on several discrete interacting proteins (type II NRPS), as seen in many bacterial systems.6,7 Each module is further divided into catalytic domains accountable for a single reaction in the incorporation and modification of a monomer unit in the chain elongation process.;  Due to the modular architecture of NRPSs, considerable attention has focused on the reprogramming of their biosynthetic machinery for the biocombinatorial synthesis of novel peptides with improved bioactivity.8,9 In the past decade, reengineered synthetases, generated by either exchanging or fusing modules10,11 or translocating domains12,13 were able to produce a library of NRP derivatives.;  However, the productivity of these engineered synthetases is hindered by poor substrate selectivity14,15 and improper protein interactions.16,17,18 Consequently, the extent to which these methods can be improved will depend on our understanding of the structural and mechanistic features of the protein interactions involved in the biosynthetic strategies of NRPSs.; In the past, great advances have been made in the structural and functional elucidation of NRPSs.;  Extensive biochemical investigations have revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of therapeutic NRPs.19 At present, the X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures of the core domains of these large biosynthetic assembly lines have been solved.20 In addition, the mechanistic function and overall modular structure of these NRPS units as well as several tailoring domains have been uncovered.21 The focus of this review will be on these investigations, which have examined the structural and functional aspects of NRPSs.;  Responsible for the incorporation of these characteristic components, such as D-amino acids, heterocyclic rings, and N-methylated residues are the auxiliary domains of NRPSs.; The modifications mentioned thus far occur during NRP synthesis.; Although NRPs are marked by structural diversity, their mode of synthesis is highly conserved.;  Classified into three categories, biosynthesis of NRPs can occur in a linear (Type A), iterative (Type B), or nonlinear (Type C) manner, as shown in Fig. 2.44 In the linear strategy (Type A, Fig. 2), the number and sequence of the modules in the NRPS matches the number and order of amino acids in the peptide.;  Lastly, nonlinear NRPSs generate peptides in which the sequence of amino acids does not correlate to the arrangement of modules on the synthetase template (Type C, Fig. 2).; Biosynthetic strategies for assembling nonribosomal peptides (NRPS).; Regardless of the biosynthetic strategy utilized by the megasynthetases, all NRP synthesis is mediated by the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) found in each NRPS module.;  The ~80 aa PCP acts as a scaffold, tethering the amino acid building blocks and peptidyl intermediates as they are modified and condensed by other domains of the NRPS.45 In addition to the PCP, the adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains constitute the three core domains that define a typical NRPS module.;  Once the amino acyl substrate has undergone all necessary modifications, the C domain catalyzes the peptide bond formation with the downstream amino acyl unit that is tethered to the PCP of the adjacent module.48 While the typical module contains these three domains, the first module of the NRP system, known as the initiation module, lacks a C domain.;  In addition to the core domains are the tailoring domains, which are responsible for the various modifications that create the diversity in NRPs (see Section 2).;  After these modifications, the final product is released from the PCP of the termination module through either hydrolysis or macrocyclization by the thioesterase (TE) domain.49 Once released, the NRP products can be further subjected to modifications by glycosyltransferases, halogenases, and oxygenases.; The PPTases form a particular group of enzymes essential for activating NRPSs to their functional state.;  Prior to NRP biosynthesis, all PCPs undergo posttranslational modification by these external enzymes.;  They are capable of modifying carrier proteins from both primary and secondary metabolism, which include NRPSs.; NRPSs utilize a specialized thioesterase domain to ensure efficient and accurate production of the final NRP product.;  The functional activity of this domain in relation to NRPS was first realized in a study in which the TEII protein associated with the antibiotics surfactin (TEIIsrf) and bacitracin (TEIIbac) were investigated for hydrolysis of acetyl-PCP substrates.61 The TEII domains were determined to hydrolyze acetyl-PCPs as well as aminoacyl- and peptidyl-CPs.;  The overall rate of NRP production was unaffected by the activity of the TEIIs, supporting the hypothesis that the main role of TEII enzymes is to regenerate the misprimed PCP domains of NRPSs.; Recently, another external thioesterase domain, RifR, from the hybrid NRPS–PKS rifamycin, demonstrated broad substrate specificity, hydrolyzing various-size carboxylated and decarboxylated acyl thioesters, with a preference for misacylated carrier proteins over the natural building blocks of rifamycin.66 Interestingly, RifR also showed preferential hydrolysis of misacylated carrier proteins over misacylated CoA analogues, emphasizing the importance of protein-protein interactions in the functionality of the TEII domains.; As for the overall structure of RifR, it maintained the same α/β-hydrolase fold as seen by previously characterized NRPS TEII domains, with a three α-helix ‘lid’ governing proper substrate binding by controlling access to the substrate chamber (Fig. 4B).; As the initial determinants of substrate selectivity in NRP biosynthesis, the adenylation domains (~550 aa) function as the gatekeepers of the NRPS assembly line.; (A) Adenylation reaction in NRPS. (B) Crystal structure of the adenylation domain, consisting of the large N-terminal domain (red and yellow) and the smaller C-terminal domain (gray), from the gramicidin S synthetase, GrsA, complexed with AMP (purple) in the presence of Mg2+ion (blue sphere).; In 1997, the first crystal structure of an NRPS A domain, the phenylalanine-activating domain (PheA) of the gramicidin S initiation module, was determined.69 Since then, only two other A domain has been resolved, the stand-alone 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid-activating domain (DhbE) of the bacillibactin NRPS,70 and the A domain of the NRPS gene sidN discovered in the fungus Neotyphodium lolii, which activates N(Δ)-cis-anhydromevalonyl-N-(Δ)-hydroxy-L-ornithine.71 Based on these crystal structures, the overall structure of the A domain consists of a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain, with the active site located at the junction of these two subdomains (Fig. 5B).;  Hence, two conformational changes appear to be necessary for the adenylation domains to properly recognize and activate their substrates for NRP biosynthesis.;  These bioinformatics tools enable quick and accurate analysis of newly identified NRPS systems, allowing for more complete characterization of novel NRPS gene clusters.; A class of small ~70 amino acid proteins, known as MbtH-like proteins, are sometimes encoded within NRPS gene clusters,88 and have been discovered to associate with the A domain.89 To aid in the elucidation of the exact function of these small proteins, the structures of PA2412 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa90 and MbtH from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,91 from which this class of proteins derives its name, have been solved., PA2412 has been analyzed both x-ray crystallography and NMR, while MbtH has been solved using NMR and CD (Fig. 6).;  Biochemical studies have helped elucidate possible roles of MbtH-like proteins in NRP biosynthesis.;  In the same study, NRPS modules from the Enterobactin biosynthetic pathway were also investigated.;  K481-B101 was found to only express solubly when coexpressed with the MbtH-like protein GlbF, which is adjacent to GlbE in the genome.94 In this case, the MbtH-like protein apparently serves as a chaparone for its cognate NRPS module.;  The PCP carries the growing natural product chain throughout the catalytic steps of NRP biosynthesis.; With the elucidation of the dynamic conformational changes exhibited by the PCP in its three different states, examination of the interactions and conformational changes of the PCP during its communication with other domains in the NRPS system followed.;  However, two mutagenesis studies on the aryl carrier protein of the enterobactin synthetase, EntB–ArCP, identified two distinct recognition sites for PPTases EntD and Sfp,99 and the serine-incorporating NRPS module, EntF.100 Key residues G242 and D244 constituted an interaction surface on EntB–ArCP for EntD and Sfp, while the residues F264 and A268 on helix III were identified as the recognition surface for EntF.; Complementing these findings were the results from another study in which aryl carrier proteins (ArCP) from VibB of Vibrio cholerae vibriobactin and HMWP2 of Yersinia pestis yersiniabactin NRPSs were evolved by random mutagenesis to reconstitute enterobactin production activity.102 Three specific surfaces on the VibB-ArCP, which corresponded to those found previously on EntB–ArCP, were identified to be responsible for recognizing catalytic domains from the enterobactin system.;  More recently, the solution structure of the EntF PCP–TE didomain elucidated the intra- and interdomain motions of the PCP during its interaction with other catalytic domains in NRP biosynthesis (Fig. 8).64; To gain further insight into the interdomain interactions that occur in cis between the PCP and other NRPS domains, crystal structures of the PCP were resolved within a bidomain in the tyrocidine system, TycC5–6 PCP–C,104 and an entire termination module of the surfactin NRPS, SrfA–C (Fig. 9).105 In both structures, the PCP was in the A/H state without the presence of phosphopantetheine.; (A) Crystal structure of the TycC5–6 PCP–C bidomain from the tyrocidine NRPS.;  Residues (orange) responsible for proper interaction between the PCP and C domain are highlighted. (B) Crystal structure of the termination module from the Bacillus subtilis surfactin NRPS, SrfA–C.; Monomeric precursors in NRP synthesis are joined together by the condensation domain, a large ~450 aa monomeric enzyme situated at the N-terminus of each elongation module that catalyzes the peptide bond formation of two aminoacyl substrates bound to PCPs of adjacent modules.108 The thioester group of the upstream donor substrate undergoes a nucleophilic attack by the α-amino group of the downstream acceptor substrate, forming an amide bond and transferring the peptide intermediate from one module to the next (Fig. 10A).;  Thus, the C domain also acts as a filter for selectivity in NRP biosynthesis.; In addition to aminoacyl and peptidyl substrates, the C domain is capable of condensing polyketide (PK) intermediates in hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide (PK/NRP) systems, as well as non-proteinogenic amino acids.;  The first condensation domain of FkbP, the four-domain (C–A–PCP–C) NRPS found in the FK520 biosynthetic pathway, was proven to condense the pipecolate moiety with the acyclic polyketide chain of the natural product.121 Even though the condensation domain of hybrid PK/NRP systems can accept both nonproteinogenic amino acids and polyketide intermediates, it does not display any distinct characteristics compared to the conventional NRPS C domain.;  This is not surprising considering that the C domain from the tyrocidine system was previously reported to exhibit relaxed substrate specificity for its donor substrate.112 Fatty acids are incorporated at the N-terminus of several NRPs, including daptomycin122 and surfactin.123 Recent investigation of the surfactin biosynthetic pathway has shed light on the mechanism of fatty acid incorporation for these lipopeptides.124 In contrast to hybrid PK/NRP systems, the fatty acid is added by the initiation module, which has a domain organization of C-A-PCP.; Different condensation reactions catalyzed by the C domain. (A) The C domain in the bleomycin NRPS subunit, BlmVII, condenses an aminoacyl substrate (blue) with a ketide unit (gold). (B) The C domain in the FK520 NRPS subunit, FkbP, catalyzes condensation between pipecolate (green) and a ketide unit (yellow). (C) The free-standing C domain, SgcC5, from the C-1027 NRPS catalyzes ester bond formation.; Besides forming peptide bonds between NRP precursors, the C domain also catalyzes ester bond formation, as first observed in the biosynthesis of fumonisin, a polyketide-derived mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticillioides.125 In this study, FUM14 was predicted to encode a PCP and C domain.;  Consequently, SgcC5 is the first known C domain to be able to catalyze both ester and amide bond formation in NRP biosynthesis, providing possible insight into how a canonical amide-forming C domain can be engineered to catalyze esterification.;  Incorporation of these unnatural amino acids can occur by either direct activation of a D-amino acid produced by an external racemase, via an A domain, such as the sixth A domain in the fusaricidin NRPS,133 or by in situ epimerization of the Cα center of the PCP-bound L-amino acid during peptide elongation.; Enzymatic reactions of the tailoring domains. (A) The cyclization (Cy) domain from the Vibrio cholerae vibriobactin NRPS subunit, VibF, catalyze cyclization of threonine to form the oxazoline ring in three steps. (B) The oxidation (Ox) domain from the epothilone synthetase B, EpoB, oxidizes the thiazoline ring to the thiazole in the presence of the cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN). (C) The reduction (R) domain from the pyochelin synthetase, PchF, reduces the thiazoline ring to the thiazolidine in the presence of NADPH.;  Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency of both reactions increased when the substrates were loaded on to a PCP, verifying yet again the vital role played by the PCP in NRP biosynthesis.;  One of the early indications for this separation of condensation and heterocyclization processes was demonstrated by the mutational study of the two different Cy domains found in the VibF NRPS of the vibriobactin system.142 Given the conserved DXXXXDXXS motif of Cy domains,143 mutation of the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the first Cy domain of VibF resulted in lower heterocyclic product formation while maintaining condensation activity, whereas the same mutation in the second Cy domain had the opposite effect.; Discussion of the Cy domain so far has been limited to those found associated with other NRPS domains.;  However, a recent study of the NRPS responsible for the biosynthesis of anguibactin, a siderophore produced by Vibrio anguillarum,145 reported the first system to comprise of two stand-alone Cy domains.; N- and C-methylation of amionacyl substrates in NRP biosynthesis. (A) The N-methyltransferase (NMT) domain from the pyochelin NRPS, PchF, transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the amine group of the substrate tethered on the PCP. (B) Crystal structure of NMT, MtfA, from the chloroeremomycin synthetase complexed with SAM (purple stick model) with one monomer designated in gray. (C) The C-methyltransferase (CMT), GlmT, from the CDA producer Streptomyces coelicolor transfers the methyl group from SAM to the β-carbon of α-ketoglutarate in a stereospecific manner.; Commonly observed in the initation of ribosomal peptide biosynthesis in prokaryotes,158 N-formylation also occurs in the biosynthesis of linear gramicidins from Bacillus brevis ATCC 8185,159 as well as the anabaenopeptilides from Anabaena strain 90.160 Responsible for catalyzing this reaction is the formylation (F) domain, one of the least explored tailoring domains in the NRPS system.; The formylation (F) domain of the Bacillus brevis linear gramicidin NRPS subunit, LgrA1, catalyzes formylation of valine in the presence of N10-formyltetrahydrofolate.; Based on enzymatic and structural studies, the flavin-dependent halogenases have been categorized into two groups: those that halogenate free small-molecule substrates (PrnA and RebH)165 and those that modify substrates bound to the PCP in the NRPS system (CndH and SgcC3).166 Until recently, only two crystal structures of the flavin-dependent halogenases involved in NRPS systems had been resolved, PrnA from Pseudomonas fluorescens167 and RebH from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes.168 Both of these halogenases belong to the first group and have aided in the elucidation of the reaction mechanism and structural features for flavin-dependent halogenation.; Halogenation of unactivated aliphatic carbon centers in nonribosomal peptides are catalyzed by the recently discovered class of non-heme Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent halogenases.175 Thus far, four of these halogenases have been characterized, with the crystal structures for two of these halogenases being resolved: SyrB2 from the syringomycin E biosynthetic pathway176 (Fig. 17A) and more recently, CytC3 from the NRPS of the Streptomyces antibiotic, γ,γ-dichloroaminobutyrate (Fig. 17B).177 Non-heme Fe(II)/αKG-dependent halogenases exhibit a common cupin fold, comprised of antiparallel β–strands in a jelly roll motif.178 At the center of the jelly roll is the iron cofactor, which is coordinated by two histidine residues.; Termination of nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis is carried out by the thioesterase (TE) domain with the release of the full-length peptidyl chain from the final PCP of the termination module.181 This 250 amino acid long enzyme, which is only found in termination modules of NRPSs,182 utilizes an active site serine residue as a nucleophilic catalyst in the two-step process liberating its peptide cargo.; (A) The thioesterase (TE) domain from the vancomycin NRPS catalyzes release of the linear peptide through hydrolysis after three crosslinking reactions. (B) The TE domain from the daptomycin NRPS catalyzes the release of the peptidic product through an intramolecular macrocyclization.;  Based on these investigations, the cyclic portion of the fengycin peptide was observed sitting “edge-on” the active site canyon with residues D-Orn3, L-Gln9, D-Tyr10, and L-Ile11 contributing to substrate binding and recognition during cyclization, in accordance with earlier findings on the substrate specificity of NRPS TE domains.185 In addition, the molecular dynamics of FenTEI placed the C-terminus of the lipopeptide in contact with the western side of the active site canyon and the nucleophilic residue interacting with the eastern and central regions of the active site.;  This is the first example of an NRPS organized in a cyclic manner, in which the synthesis begins and ends with the same module.; Recently, a prototypical TE was discovered to catalyze both macrolactonization and macrothiolactonization (Fig. 21).189 The TioS PCP–TE bidomain, excised from the thiocoraline NRPS of Micromonospora ML1,190 was examined for substrate selectivity and utilized for in vitro generation of thiocoraline analogs.; Throughout this review, investigations of the different catalytic domains have emphasized the importance of intramodular protein-protein interactions in regulating NRP biosynthesis.;  The following two sections will discuss the discovery of the domains responsible for the intermodular protein interactions which have advanced our understanding and ability to manipulate the NRP synthetases in order to produce more potent bioactive peptidic compounds.; Initially, it was believed that condensation between peptide intermediates of consecutive NRPS enzymes was mediated by protein-protein interactions between the C-terminal domain of the first synthetase and the N-terminal domain of the second synthetase.;  However, small 15–25 aa recognition regions called communication-mediating (COM) domains were determined to be important for regulating the intermodular protein interactions between NRPSs.17 Located at the C-terminus of the donor NRPS, the donor COM domain (COMD) interacts specifically with its cognate partner, the acceptor COM domain (COMA), which is situated at the N-terminus of the acceptor NRPS (Fig. 22A).;  The two COM domains form a compatible set, ensuring selective protein interactions in order to condense the appropriate peptide intermediates in NRP biosynthesis.; (A) COM domains from the tyrocidine system regulate the protein interactions between the first two modules, TycA and TycB1, for proper processing of the aminoacyl substrates, L-Phe and L-Pro, to form the dipeptidyl intermediate. (B) Pantetheine azide and difluorocyclooctyne pantetheine modified the PCPs of TycA and TycB1, respectively, and displayed sensitivity to the protein interactions governed by the COM domains of these cognate partner NRPSs through crosslinking.; More recently, crosslinking probes were developed to investigate the protein-protein interactions mediated by the COM domains in the tyrocidine NRPS system.195 Utilizing a one-pot chemoenzymatic carrier protein modification method,196 synthesized pantetheine azides and alkynes were loaded on to the PCP of the first two modules of the tyrocidine system, TycA and TycB1.;  However, a ring strain-activated cyclooctyne pantetheine analogue exhibited selective protein-protein interaction-dependent crosslinking of cognate NRPS modules (Fig. 22B).; With the discovery of hybrid NRP–PK natural products, exploration of the docking domains governing the protein-protein interactions between NRPS and PKS enzymes in hybrid systems became a necessity in order to comprehend the interplay between these two types of modular synthases for combinatorial biosynthesis.;  Earlier studies of the mixed PKS–NRPS epothilone system illustrated that manipulation of the docking domains between its synthases was plausible; however, this came at the expense of decreased chain elongation efficiency.197,198 Despite the conserved architecture and catalytic function shared by these synthases, it is surprising to find that the docking system used in hybrid systems are quite different from those in purely PKS or NRPS systems.; In a recent structural study of the tubulysin system of Angiococcus disciformis An d48, a new family of N-terminal docking domains was identified.199 Based on multiple sequence alignments of mixed PKS–NRPS systems, TubCdd, the N-terminal docking domain of TubC, was established to be a representative of the N-terminal docking domains found between NRPS–NRPS and PKS–NRPS interfaces in these hybrid systems.;  Structural analysis of TubCdd by NMR revealed this domain to be homodimeric, suggesting that NRPS enzymes in hybrid systems self-associate in order to recognize and interact with C-terminal PKS partner domains.; This review summarizes the key investigations and remarkable breakthroughs in the structural and mechanistic elucidation of the catalytic domains engaged in NRP biosynthesis.;  Given the modular organization of NRPSs, it is clear that defining the intra- and intermodular protein interactions governing proper processing of NRP precursors is vital to the comprehension of such intricately designed molecular machines.;  As a result, many of the endeavors discussed in this review have focused on resolving the issues regarding the selective communication between NRPS enzymes.; In particular, mutational, NMR, and X-ray crystallographic studies have identified key residues, facilitating proper protein-protein interactions, at the recognition interfaces of several NRPS subunits.; Another critical issue regarding NRP synthesis highlighted in this review is the identification of the active site residues governing substrate specificity of the domains.;  Moreover, with the discovery of SgcC5, further investigations exploring the mechanistic and structural aspects of the this C domain holds great promise into gaining a better understanding of the selectivity for a hydroxy or amine nucleophile of the acceptor substrate in the condensation reaction of NRP synthesis.;  Although the characterization of the SrfTEI and FenTEI domains elucidated certain fundamental features involved in macrocyclization, further investigations into other NRPS TE domains is required to fully understand the determinants of intramolecular cyclization versus intermolecular hydrolysis as well.; Finally, the recent discovery of the COM domains in NRPSs as well as the docking domains situated at the NRPS–PKS interface found in hybrid systems revealed another level of regulation in these multienzyme complexes.; It is without a doubt that future endeavors towards deciphering the protein interactions at both the domain and modular level, by means of biochemical and structural techniques, will bring forth new findings that will help us gain a better grasp of the subtle intricacies influencing the enzymatic reactions involved in NRP synthesis.",
Oatp1a1,28248,22496825,3319588,"Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a1 (Oatp1a1) is predominantly expressed in liver and is able to transport bile acids (BAs) in vitro.;  Male Oatp1a1-null mice have increased concentrations of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), a secondary BA generated by intestinal bacteria, in both serum and livers.;  Therefore, in the present study, BA concentrations and intestinal bacteria in wild-type (WT) and Oatp1a1-null mice were quantified to investigate whether the increase of secondary BAs in Oatp1a1-null mice is due to alterations in intestinal bacteria.;  The data demonstrate that Oatp1a1-null mice : (1) have similar bile flow and BA concentrations in bile as WT mice; (2) have a markedly different BA composition in the intestinal contents, with a decrease in conjugated BAs and an increase in unconjugated BAs; (3) have BAs in the feces that are more deconjugated, desulfated, 7-dehydroxylated, 3-epimerized, and oxidized, but less 7-epimerized; (4) have 10-fold more bacteria in the small intestine, and 2-fold more bacteria in the large intestine which is majorly due to a 200% increase in Bacteroides and a 30% reduction in Firmicutes; and (5) have a different urinary excretion of bacteria-related metabolites than WT mice.;  In conclusion, the present study for the first time established that lack of a liver transporter (Oatp1a1) markedly alters the intestinal environment in mice, namely the bacteria composition.; Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs; rodents: Oatps) mediate the transport of a variety of structurally diverse endogenous compounds (such as prostaglandins, thyroid hormones, conjugated steroids, and BAs) and xenobiotics (such as anticancer drugs, antibiotics, cardiac glycosides, and some peptides) [16]. In mice, Oatp1a1, 1a4, and 1b2 are predominantly expressed in liver [17]. Oatp1a1 has been shown to transport BAs, such as taurocholic acid (TCA) in vitro
[18]. Thus, Oatp1a1 is thought to transport BAs in vivo from blood into liver.;  In a previous study, Oatp1a1-null mice were found to have increased secondary BAs (DCA and TDCA) in serum, a finding that could not be attributed to decreased hepatic uptake, as might be expected in this model [19]. These Oatp1a1-null mice also showed increased urinary excretion of isethionic acid, a taurine metabolite produced by intestinal bacteria [20], suggesting potential perturbations in the intestinal microbiome.;  Accordingly, we hypothesized that the increase of DCA and TDCA in serum of Oatp1a1-null mice is due to an increase in intestinal bacteria, and therefore the purpose of the present study is to investigate the in vivo role of Oatp1a1 in BA metabolism and intestinal bacteria composition.; A previous study demonstrated that secondary BAs including DCA and TDCA, which are produced by intestinal bacteria, were increased in the serum of Oatp1a1-null mice [19]. To investigate whether the increased secondary BAs in serum of Oatp1a1-null mice is due to alterations in intestinal BA metabolism, the BA concentrations in the feces of Oatp1a1-null mice were quantified.;  Lack of Oatp1a1 markedly decreased TCA (80%), TCDCA (60%), TαMCA (80%), and TβMCA (90%).;  Lack of Oatp1a1 decreased CA about 65%, but had no effect on CDCA.;  Lack of Oatp1a1 increased αMCA about 95%, but decreased βMCA about 30%. BA sulfates can be desulfated by bacterial enzymes in the intestine [21], and in Oatp1a1-null mice, sulfated BAs were markedly decreased.;  These included TCA-7S and TCDCA-7S, which were virtually non-detectable in the Oatp1a1-null mice, as well as 40% decrease in CA-7S and 80% decrease in CDCA-7S (Fig. 2c).;  Taken together, lack of Oatp1a1 appeared to alter both the conjugation and sulfation of BAs in the intestine of mice.; Feces were collected from WT and Oatp1a1-null mice for 24 hr and dried under vacuum.;  The concentrations of primary BAs (a, b, and c) and secondary BAs (d, e, and f) in the feces of male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 5/group) were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and normalized by fecal dry weight.;  All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of five mice in each group. *, statistically significant difference between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (p<0.05).;  In mice, MDCA is thought to be produced by 7-dehydroxylation of βMCA, and HDCA is produced by further epimerization of MDCA [22]. Lack of Oatp1a1 increased GDCA (420%), TMDCA (170%), and THDCA (1700%), DCA (1300%), LCA (1900%), and HDCA (1700%) (Fig. 2d and 2e).;  UDCA is produced by 7-epimerization of CDCA by bacterial enzymes in the intestine [23], and in the absence of Oatp1a1, both TUDCA and UDCA were decreased 75 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 2d and 2e).;  Therefore, lack of functional Oatp1a1 increased 7-dehydroxylation, but decreased 7-epimerization of BAs in the intestine of mice.;  The concentrations of isoDCA (1300%) and isoLCA (1900%) were increased markedly in feces of Oatp1a1-null mice (Fig. 2f).;  The concentrations of oxo-BAs, such as dehydroLCA (4300%), 6-oxoLCA (700%), 7-oxoLCA (70%), and 12-oxoLCA (1300%) were also increased markedly in the feces of Oatp1a1-null mice (Fig. 2f).;  Therefore, lack of Oatp1a1 increased 3-epimerization and oxidation of BAs in the intestine of mice.; To investigate whether BA alterations in feces are due to altered hepatic BA metabolism and/or biliary BA excretion, the concentrations of individual BAs in livers and bile of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice were quantified.;  Lack of Oatp1a1 had little effect on the concentrations of unconjugated BAs in liver (Fig. 3a).;  Lack of Oatp1a1 also had little effect on most conjugated BAs in liver, except that it increased the concentration of TDCA about 200% (Fig. 3b).;  In addition, lack of Oatp1a1 had no effects on bile flow (data not shown) or the concentrations of BAs in bile of mice (Fig. 3c and 3d).;  Taken together, lack of Oatp1a1 increased TDCA concentrations in liver, but had little effect on the composition of BAs in bile.; BA concentrations in livers and bile of male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 5/group) were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).;  All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for five mice in each group. *, statistically significant difference between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (p<0.05).; Because the concentrations of BAs in bile are similar between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice, alterations in the fecal BA composition are most likely caused by changes in BA metabolism in the intestinal contents.;  As shown in Fig. 4a, the major unconjugated BAs in the small intestinal contents of WT mice were ωMCA, βMCA, and CA, whereas in Oatp1a1-null mice, unconjugated BAs were markedly increased including CA (330%), MDCA (1150%), UDCA (170%), HDCA (220%), CDCA (130%), and DCA (1000%).;  In contrast in Oatp1a1-null mice, TMCA (60%) and TUDCA (81%) were decreased markedly.; BA concentrations in the intestinal contents of male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 5/group) were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).;  All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for five mice in each group. *, statistically significant difference between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (p<0.05).;  Lack of Oatp1a1 decreased βMCA (40%) and UDCA (69%), but increased CDCA (210%), MDCA (320%), HDCA (150%), DCA (310%), and LCA (320%) (Fig. 4d).;  Lack of Oatp1a1 decreased TMCA (70%), TUDCA (70%), and TCDCA (50%), but increased TDCA about 280% in the large intestinal contents (Fig. 4d).; To investigate whether altered BA metabolism in the intestinal contents of Oatp1a1-null mice is due to alterations in intestinal bacteria, we developed a 16 S rDNA-based assay to quantify bacteria in the intestinal contents of Oatp1a1-null mice.;  Fig. 5a illustrates the relative amount of Clostridia in both small and large intestine of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice.;  In the small intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice, there was an increase in the following bacteria: C. absonum (85%), C. perfringens (350%), C. scindens (100%), C. methylpentosum (110%), and C. sp.;  In contrast, the large intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice showed a decrease in almost all Clostridia, including C. absonum (30%), C. perfringens (30%), C. sindens (50%), C. fusiformis (30%), C. celerecrescens (30%), C. sp.; Clostridia (a), Bacteroides (b), Lactobacilli (c), and other bacteria (d) in the small and large intestinal contents of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice were quantified using a branched DNA assay (Panomics/Affymetrix, Fremont, CA).;  All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of five mice in each group. *, statistically significant difference between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (p<0.05).; As shown in Fig. 5b, the small intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice had a 50–100 fold increase in almost all the Bacteroides, including Ba. acidifaciens, Ba. forsythus (i and ii), Ba. vulgatus, Ba. sp.;  In addition, the large intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice also had an increase in Ba. acidofaciens (105%), Ba. forsythus (ii and ii) (250%), Ba. sp.; The small intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice had an increase in several Lactobacilli (Fig. 5c), such as La. acidophilus (190%), La. reuteri (200%), and La. sp.;  In contrast, the large intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice had a decrease in La. acidophilus (13%) and La. murinus (40%).; As shown in Fig. 5d, the small intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice underwent a 100–800% increase in Lactococcus lactis, Klebsiella granulomatis, Streptococcus gordnii, Eubacterium desmolans, Ralstonia sp., Eubacterium limosum, Acetibibrio cellulosolvens, and Ruminococcus gnavus, as well as 2000–10,000% increase in Prevotella sp. (i, and ii), Porphyromonas sp.(i), Desulfovibrio sp., and Porphyromonas sp.(ii).;  In contrast, the large intestine of Oatp1a1-null mice underwent a decrease in Streptococcus gordnii (25%), Ruminococcus schinkii (40%), Ruminococcus gnavus (35%), but increased Prevotella sp. (i, and ii) (200%), Porphyromonas sp. (i) (170%), Porphyromonas sp. (ii) (9000%), and Helicobactor sp. (600%).;  Fig. 6 illustrates the mRNA expression of Fxr, Shp, and Fgf15 in ilea as well as Fgfr4 in livers of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice.;  Lack of Oatp1a1 had little effect on ileal Fxr mRNA expression, whereas Oatp1a1-null mice had lower ileal Shp mRNA than did WT mice.;  In addition, Oatp1a1-null mice tended to have lower mRNA expression of Fgf15 in ilea and Fgfr4 in livers than WT mice, although this difference was not statistically significant.; Total RNA from ilea and livers of male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 5/group) was analyzed using multiplex suspension array.;  All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of five mice in each group. *, statistically significant difference between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (p<0.05).;  To investigate the effects of the altered intestinal bacteria on host metabolism, we collected the urine of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice and performed metabolomic analysis using UPLC-TOF-MS.;  Consistent with a previous study [20], urinary metabonomic analysis in the present study also revealed a distinct separation between WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (Fig.;  By comparison of the retention time in the same MS/MS chromatograph window between authentic standards and urine samples, we identified that Oatp1a1-null mice had higher hippuric acid, but lower indole-3-carboxylic acid-glucuronide (indole-3-carboxylic acid-G) in urine than WT mice (Fig. 7).;  In addition, Oatp1a1-null mice had lower glucuronides of daidzein and O-desmethylangolensin in urine than WT mice (Fig.; Structural elucidations were performed based on accurate mass measurement and MS/MS fragmentations of hippuric acid (a) and indole-3-carboxylic acid-glucuronide (b) in urine of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice.;  In the present study, we utilized Oatp1a1-null mice and illustrated that this transporter contributes to the regulation of intestinal bacteria population.;  In the present study, Oatp1a1-null mice were shown to have a markedly different profile of intestinal bacteria, which resulted in the altered urinary excretion of bacteria-formed metabolites such as hippuric acid and indole-3-carboxylic acid [27], [28]. The novelty of the present finding that loss of Oatp1a1 function leads to alterations in intestinal bacteria is indicative of the complex and relatively unexplored relationship between intestinal bacteria and other organs such as liver.;  Table S1 and S2 summarized the concentrations or composition of BAs in tissues or contents of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice.;  Oatp1a1-null mice had similar bile flow (data not shown) and BA concentrations in the bile as WT mice (Fig. 3c and 3d), suggesting that lack of Oatp1a1 does not alter the amounts of BAs entering the small intestine.;  However, due to the increase in small intestinal bacteria, conjugated BAs (TMCA and TUDCA) decreased, whereas unconjugated BAs (CA, MDCA, HDCA, UDCA, CDCA, and DCA) increased in the small intestinal contents of Oatp1a1-null mice (Fig. 4a and 4b).;  Consistently, Oatp1a1-null mice also had a markedly different BA profile in the feces, with a decrease in conjugated primary BAs (taurine-, glycine-, and sulfate-conjugated BAs) and an increase in secondary BAs that are produced by 7-dehydroxylation, oxidation, and epimerization (Fig. 2).;  Unlike other secondary BAs, both TUDCA and UDCA were decreased in the feces of Oatp1a1-null mice (Fig. 2).;  This may be due to the decrease in C. absonum, which expresses both 7α- and 7β-HSDHs, and thus is able to epimerize CDCA to UDCA [7], [8]. Despite the marked changes in BA composition, Oatp1a1-null mice had a similar fecal excretion of total BAs as WT mice (data not shown), consistent with the similar biliary excretion of BAs into the intestine.;  The intestinal microbiota in both humans and mice consist mainly of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla [3], [4]. The relative proportion of Bacteroidetes is decreased in obese people, and increased when these obese people change to a low-calorie diet [33]. Similarly, genetically obese (ob/ob) mice have a 50% reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, in the cecal contents [33]. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein expression of Oatp1a1 in livers of obese (ob/ob) mice were diminished to <5% and <15%, respectively, of that in WT mice [34]. In addition, hepatic Oatp1a1 is also suppressed by a high-fat diet in rats [35]. In contrast to ob/ob mice, the present study shows that Oatp1a1-null mice have a 200% increase of Bacteroidetes, and a 30% reduction of Firmicutes in the large intestine.;  Thus, there is evidence to suggest that Oatp1a1 expression is altered in the face of metabolic disease such as obesity, and that the function of this transporter is critical for the homeostasis of intestinal bacteria populations.;  Lack of Oatp1a1 decreases the concentrations of conjugated BAs in ilea, and thus may decrease the influx of BAs into ileal enterocytes, resulting in decreased FXR activation.;  Although lack of Oatp1a1 had little effect on ileal FXR mRNA expression, it significantly decreased the mRNA expression of ileal SHP, a target gene of FXR (Figure 6).;  In addition, both ileal Fgf15 and hepatic Fgfr4 mRNA expression tend to decrease in Oatp1a1-null mice.;  This indicates that Oatp1a1-null mice may have a decreased BA-mediated FXR activation in the ilea, which may contribute to the overgrowth of intestinal bacteria.;  However, it remains unclear how lack of Oatp1a1 alters the intestinal bacteria.;  It is also possible that lack of Oatp1a1 alters the disposition of some endogenous substrates, other than BAs, which are important in maintaining normal intestinal functions.;  The alteration of OATP expression and activities can affect the plasma concentration of drugs, thereby significantly influencing drug toxicities, therapeutic efficacies, and drug-drug interactions [37]. The present study suggests that inhibition of Oatp1a1 in mice may result in an overgrowth of intestinal bacteria and thereby an increase of secondary BAs in serum and intestinal contents.;  For example, loss of Oatp1a1 function alters urinary excretion of daidzein and its bacteria-mediated metabolite O-desmethylangolensin, which have been shown to have beneficial effects on obesity, hypertension, cholesterol, and glucose levels in animals and humans [38]. Therefore, the effects of OATPs/Oatps on intestinal bacteria, BA metabolism, and host metabolomics should be considered when studying drug-induced liver injuries and drug-drug interactions.;  Oatp1a1-null mice were bred to homozygosity on the C57BL/6 background as described previously [20]. All mice were housed in an American Animal Associations Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) accredited facility with a 12∶12 hr light∶dark cycle and provided chow (Teklad Rodent Diet #8604, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.; Age-matched male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 6/group) were anesthetized i.p. using ketamine (100 mg/kg)/midazolam (5 mg/kg) and the common bile duct was cannulated with a 30-gauge needle attached to PE-10 tubing.; Age-matched male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 9/group) were acclimated to metabolic cages (housed individually), and feces were collected on ice over a 24-hr period.; Age-matched male WT and Oatp1a1-null mice (n = 6/group) were anesthetized, and intestinal contents were collected in phosphate buffered saline containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.; The bacteria evaluated in the present study were chosen based on a previous report on the major intestinal microflora in mice [4]. Because the majority of the bacteria residing in the intestine were unculturable, the bacterial seuqneces are defined as the closest known relative in the phylogenic tree [4]. A strategy based on quantification of the 16 S rDNA gene by branched DNA (bDNA) assay was utilized to compare the composition of intestinal microbiota of WT and Oatp1a1-null mice.;

PA2449,882923,23457254,3624589," Using a combination of microarray and metabolite analyses, we demonstrate that the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 are both dependent on the PA2449 gene.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene was found to influence the transcription of a core set of genes encoding a glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and serine dehydratase.;  PA2449 also affected the transcription of several genes that are integral in cell signaling and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  PA2449 is conserved among pseudomonads and might be universally involved in the assimilation of glycine among this metabolically diverse group of bacteria.;  The putative transcriptional regulator PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was not only necessary for the production of pyocyanin but also essential for the assimilation of glycine as a carbon source.;  Understanding the relationship between glycine metabolism, pyocyanin biosynthesis, and the PA2449 gene was the main goal of the current study.;  Importantly, the results of our study provide a foundation for defining the role of PA2449 in the general metabolism and physiology of Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The DNA region containing the putative PA2449 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR.;  The gel-purified PA2449 PCR product was cloned into pCR-Blunt to give the plasmid pBRL408.;  The PA2449 ORF was subcloned from pBRL408 into the NdeI/EcoR I restriction sites of pET28b (Novagen) to yield the plasmid pBRL417.;  Subsequently, pBRL417 was digested with XbaI and SacI to liberate the PA2449 ORF with a 5′ ribosome binding site (RBS), which was then ligated into the XbaI/SacI sites of pBBR1MCS-5 to generate the plasmid pBRL435.; In addition to being a putative TyrR-like protein, the PA2449 protein also possesses homology to transcriptional regulators known as enhancer binding proteins (EBPs) that interact with the alternative sigma factor σ54 (RpoN) to activate transcription (40).;  The RpoN interaction domain is conserved in the PA2449 protein(see Fig.;  Because the PA2449 protein displays homology to both PhhR (44% identity) of P. aeruginosa and TyrR (41% identity) of E. coli, we suspected that PA2449 might also be involved in phenazine biosynthesis.; A P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain possessing a transposon insertion within the PA2449 gene was obtained from the P. aeruginosa PAO1 transposon mutant library (33).;  Therefore, because of the historical importance of PIA, we focused our experiments on defining the relationship between the PA2449 gene and pyocyanin biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown in gelatin-based PB.;  Expression of the PA2449 ORF from the lac promoter of pBBR1MCS-5 (pBRL435) restored PCA and pyocyanin biosynthesis in PW5126.;  These data indicate that production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 requires the PA2449 gene.; To verify that the pyocyanin deficiency of PW5126 was the result of the transposon insertion in the PA2449 gene, the PA2449 ORF of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was cloned into the broad-host-range vector pBBR1MCS-5 and the resulting plasmid (pBRL435) was electroporated into PW5126.;  Nonetheless, the sole expression of the PA2449 ORF was sufficient to restore pyocyanin production in PW5126, thus confirming that a functional PA2449 gene is required for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  This indicated that PCA biosynthesis was still operative in the absence of PA2449, albeit at extremely low levels.; It was initially believed that the absence of the PA2449 gene could disrupt the biosynthesis of key metabolites, e.g., chorismate, that are necessary for the production of phenazines.;  We next examined if the PA2449 gene was necessary for activating or upregulating the expression of genes required for phenazine biosynthesis.;  This change in phzB1, phzB2, and phzM expression was not observed for the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  Expression of the phzH-lacZ construct was not affected by the PA2449 mutation (Fig. 3D).;  Our concern was therefore that the pyocyanin-deficient phenotype of PW5126 was due to low or insufficient levels of HSLs, e.g., C4-HSL, as a result of the PA2449 mutation.;  However, the exogenous addition of HSLs to PW5126 cultures did not restore pyocyanin production, thereby suggesting that involvement of PA2449 is more complex than simply via HSL mechanisms.;  The inactivation of the PA2449 gene did not appear to have an overall negative effect on quinolone biosynthesis.;  A more detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of individual PQS signaling molecules is required to gain an accurate picture on how the disruption of the PA2449 gene affects the PQS network in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The assimilation of glycine as a carbon source was dependent on the PA2449 gene in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  In conclusion, the PA2449 gene was essential for the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on glycine as a sole carbon but not a nitrogen source.;  The elevated glycine concentrations generated in PW5126 cultures are indicative of a deficiency in glycine assimilation and are consistent with PA2449 being involved in glycine metabolism for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; PA2449 was observed to be essential for both pyocyanin biosynthesis and the utilization of glycine, and its deletion had a deleterious effect on the synthesis of C4-HSL.;  To elucidate how these processes are related through the PA2449 gene, we used microarrays to determine the transcriptome of PW5126.;  It was expected that the resulting transcriptomic data would provide key information on the involvement of PA2449 in both glycine assimilation and the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; As established earlier, disruption of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL in PB.;  The microarray data also provided some insight into how the disruption of PA2449 may exert its influence on C4-HSL biosynthesis.; Selected list of genes having >2-fold changes in transcript levels in a transposon insertion PA2449 mutant (PW5126) compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in PB; In sharp contrast to the overabundance of genes regulated by C4-HSL signaling identified in the microarray experiments, only a limited number of genes represent potential candidates of PA2449 regulation and are restricted to those involved in glycine metabolism (Fig. 6).;  On the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, the PA2449 gene is localized near a gene cluster that encodes proteins involved in glycine and serine metabolism: gcvT2 (PA2442), sdaA (PA2443), glyA2 (PA2444), gcvP2 (PA2445), and gcvH2 (PA2446).;  These data and the previous observation that PA2449 was essential for glycine utilization support a probable role for PA2449 in regulating glycine metabolism in P. aeruginosa PAO1, possibly through facilitating the transcriptional activation of the gcvT2, sdaA, glyA2, gcvP2, and gcvH2 genes.; Key pathways of glycine assimilation that might be regulated by PA2449 in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Several genes whose products are predicted to be involved in glycine/serine metabolism were observed to be transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of a functional PA2449 gene.;  A follow-up lacZ reporter assay of the hcnA promoter confirmed that its activation was PA2449 dependent (Fig. 7B).;  PA2449 might provide another layer of regulation, which mediates the expression of hcnABC in the presence of excess intracellular glycine in P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  Examination of the metE-lacZ reporter revealed it to be activated only in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig. 7C); there was a >90% decrease in expression from the metE promoter in the absence of PA2449.;  It is probable that PA2449 positively regulates the expression of metE to increase metabolic flux from glycine to methionine.;  These findings indicate that the decreased expression of metE observed from PW5126 is due to elevated intracellular concentrations of glycine/serine, which could not be sufficiently metabolized in the absence of PA2449.;  Coordinating the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus with the activation of genes whose products function in SAM biosynthesis, e.g., metE and gcvT2H2P2, via PA2449 could mutually enhance pyocyanin biosynthesis.;  Whether PA2449 functions in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the production of C4-HSL and pyocyanin requires further exploration.; Serine dehydratase (encoded by sdaA) is necessary for the optimal growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in PB. (A) Pyocyanin production from P. aeruginosa mutants possessing transposon insertions within genes that are potential candidates of regulation by PA2449.; Proposed models for PA2449 in regulating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL and pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Transcription of mexEF-oprN, encoding an efflux pump, is repressed by PA2449.;  This prevents the efflux of intracellular PQS, thus enhancing the expression of rhl-related genes and phenotypes, including phenazine production. (B) The PA2449 protein directly activates the transcription of the C4-HSL synthase gene, rhlI, thereby facilitating the expression of the rhl network. (C) PA2449 operates independently of the rhl network to activate the expression of phz-related genes for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.; The PA2449 gene, which encodes a putative TyrR-like transcriptional regulator, was essential for P. aeruginosa PAO1 to assimilate glycine as a carbon source.;  Disruption of the PA2449 gene also reduced the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on both serine and valine when either one was supplied as a carbon source.;  In contrast, the necessity of the PA2449 gene for optimal growth on valine cannot be readily explained and remains unclear.;  The PA2449 gene was not required for the utilization of any amino acid, including glycine and serine, as a source of nitrogen.;  This suggests that a possible function of PA2449 is to aid in the metabolism of glycine as a carbon but not nitrogen source for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; Microarray analysis revealed that the disruption of the PA2449 gene affected the transcription of genes encoding proteins of a glycine cleavage system (GcvT2, GcvH2, and GcvP2), a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA2), and a serine dehydratase (SdaA).;  Dysregulation of the glyA2 and sdaA genes would limit the metabolic flux of serine into glycine or pyruvate, respectively. glyA2 and sdaA dysregulation could account for the reduced growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on serine (as a carbon source) in the absence of PA2449.; Whether the PA2449 protein functions as a direct transcriptional activator for any of the genes located within the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus remains to be answered.;  However, the only genes related to glycine metabolism that were transcriptionally downregulated in the absence of PA2449 were gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 and glyA1.;  For example, the transcription of other choline-related catabolic genes (63), including sdaB and soxBDAG, was unaffected by the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Lastly, the transcription of genes whose products could participate in glycine metabolism, e.g., glyA3 and gcvP1H1T1 (PA5213 to PA5215), was unaffected by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene.; PA2449 may provide another tier of transcriptional regulation of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus.;  For example, PA2449 might upregulate the transcription of the gcvT2-sdaA-glyA2-gcvP2-gcvH2 locus to ensure that the resulting GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA pathway has sufficient activity to meet the cellular demands associated with having to assimilate glycine as the only available carbon source.;  The PA2449 gene is conserved among pseudomonads, in which it lies in proximity to genes encoding a serine dehydratase and/or glycine cleavage system.;  The regulation of glycine and possibly serine catabolism by PA2449 might therefore be a universal phenomenon among Pseudomonas-related bacteria.; The production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was completely dependent on the PA2449 gene regardless of environmental conditions.;  Under a variety of different growth conditions and medium formulations, the PA2449 gene was essential for the production of pyocyanin.;  Specifically, the PA2449 gene was required for the transcriptional activation of genes, i.e., phzA1, phzA2, and phzM, necessary for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin.;  Without the PA2449 gene, the basal level of transcription of the phz genes was sufficient for allowing the production of PCA at trace quantities.;  We later found that the cause for the decreased transcription of the phz genes in the absence of PA2449 was insufficient levels of C4-HSL (discussed below), which is involved in phz gene activation.; This study characterized the relationship between the PA2449 gene and the production of pyocyanin under nutritionally poor growth conditions, i.e., glycine was the predominant source of carbon, phosphate was in limiting concentrations, and both aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids were in scarce supply.;  Because glycine (serine) is a biosynthetic precursor to thiols/purines and a product of protein turnover, a reduction in these processes could cause a gradual increase in intracellular glycine (serine) concentrations that is eventually countered by PA2449.;  Metabolomic analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at the onset of pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation is required to validate the existence of such a scenario involving PA2449-directed glycine metabolism.; The inactivation of the PA2449 gene significantly reduced the production of C4-HSL from P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  These findings indicate that the pyocyanin-null phenotype associated with the disruption of the PA2449 gene is a result of low or insufficient levels of C4-HSL, which consequently prevent RhlR from transcriptionally activating the phz genes required for pyocyanin biosynthesis.; Although we established that the production of C4-HSL requires a functional PA2449 gene, the reasoning or mechanism(s) underlying their relationship has not yet been determined.;  The data presented herein show that PA2449 is necessary for the catabolism of glycine as a carbon source, but QS also has also been shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in glycine metabolism (65).;  It is possible that glycine metabolism might be transcriptionally regulated only through QS in which PA2449 acts as an intermediary for facilitating the biosynthesis of C4-HSL in response to glycine availability.;  However, ΔrhlR, ΔlasR, and ΔrhlR ΔlasR P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants readily grew on minimal media with glycine as the sole carbon source; a trait not shared by the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  This suggests that glycine metabolism is dependent on PA2449 through mechanisms apart from QS in P. aeruginosa PAO1.; The necessity of the PA2449 gene, and possibly glycine metabolism, for the biosynthesis of C4-HSL is an intriguing question.;  In support of this mode of inhibition, we did observe that the transcription of the methionine synthase gene, metE, was repressed either by the inactivation of the PA2449 gene or through the exogenous addition of glycine/serine to P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures.;  However, the addition of methionine or heterologous expression of the E. coli metE gene in the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant did not restore C4-HSL to levels sufficient for triggering the production of pyocyanin.; The reduced production of C4-HSL in the absence of the PA2449 gene could be attributed to the decreased transcription (>3-fold) of the C4-HSL synthase gene rhlI.;  The role of PA2449 in the transcription of rhlI was narrowed down to a few possible factors (Fig. 9).;  First, we observed elevated transcription (>50-fold) of the pump-encoding mexEF-oprN genes with the disruption of the PA2449 gene.;  Therefore, PA2449 might function in the repression of the mexEF-oprN locus to ensure the accumulation of intracellular PQS for activation of the rhl network and subsequent C4-HSL biosynthesis (Fig. 9A).;  If indeed this is the mode of regulation by PA2449 of rhlI expression, it is expected that deletion of the mexEF-oprN locus in the PA2449 mutant (PW5126) will restore intracellular PQS to levels sufficient for mediating C4-HSL biosynthesis.;  Closer inspection of a ΔPA2449 ΔmexEF-oprN P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant for these physiological traits is an objective of future studies.; How PA2449 affects transcription of mexEF-oprN is unclear.;  Perhaps the PA2449 protein functions as this “unknown” repressor protein to facilitate the biosynthesis of C4-HSL under nutrient-poor conditions.;  In addition, the transcription of mexS (PA2493) genes was upregulated by 12-fold in the absence of PA2449.;  An additional regulator, MvaT (PA4315), which affects the expression of several QS-related genes such as mexEF-oprN (68), was not observed to be differentially transcribed between wild-type cells and the transposon insertion PA2449 mutant.;  The mechanism by which PA2449 regulates the mexEF-oprN locus is currently being investigated.; In addition to influencing the transcription of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump genes, the PA2449 protein might serve as a direct transcriptional activator for the rhlI gene (Fig. 9B).;  The PA2449 protein is predicted to be an EBP, so it is plausible that it interacts with RpoN to mediate expression of the rhlI locus.;  Further in-depth studies will clarify the role of PA2449 in the production C4-HSL for P. aeruginosa PAO1.; This study characterizes the physiological and genetic effects of a transposon deletion PA2449 mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1.;  The PA2449 gene is predicted to encode either a TyrR or EBP type transcriptional regulator.;  This ambiguity is due to the fact that the PA2449 protein possess homology to both the TyrR protein of E. coli and the EBP PhhR of P. aeruginosa.;  However, an alignment between these three proteins shows that the primary sequence of the PA2449 protein is 44% identical to that of PhhR and 41% identical to that of E. coli TyrR.;  Additionally, there is a stretch of ∼8 amino acid residues unique to only the PA2449 protein and PhhR.;  Several of the genes that are potentially regulated by the PA2449 protein, including gcvH2, phzB1, and rhlI, possess putative RpoN promoters (http://www.sigma54.ca/promoterdata/Web/data.aspx).;  These data support a probable role for the PA2449 protein as an EBP that interacts with RpoN to mediate transcription under conditions in which glycine is the predominant carbon source.; To biochemically characterize and verify that the PA2449 protein behaves as an EBP, it is imperative to determine the intracellular signal(s) sensed by this protein.;  Our data clearly show that PA2449 is involved in glycine metabolism, so an obvious candidate for triggering the PA2449 protein into an active state is glycine or possibly its metabolic counterpart serine.;  The PA2449 protein may interact with a specific THF derivative, thus activating expression of GcvP2H2T2-GlyA2-SdaA and subsequently restoring balance to the THF pool.;  PA2449 was involved in C4-HSL biosynthesis by possibly augmenting the PQS response.;  Does the PA2449 protein respond to PQS? We are currently examining the biochemical function of the PA2449 protein and attempting to define its in vivo targets in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when grown under glycine-rich, pyocyanin-producing conditions.",
PAO1,228608,19054330,2680260," Inactivation of pilY1 led to the loss of twitching motility in twitching-proficient wild-type PA14 and PAO1 strains, predisposed to autolysis and impaired the secretion of quinolones and pyocyanin, but on the other hand promoted growth in stationary phase and bacterial survival in murine airway infection models.;  PilY1 of P. aeruginosa PAO1 shares 43% homology to the C-terminal sequence of PilC2 of Neisseria meningitidis and of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.;  Complementation in trans with the functional PAO1 pilQ gene conferred twitching to TBCF10839 to levels seen in reference strain PAO1, but did not restore twitching in the pilY1 mutant (Fig.;  The pilY1 gene of strain TBCF10839 was sequenced and highly sensitive and specific polyclonal peptide anti-PilY1 antibodies were raised against epitopes that are shared between the PilY1 orthologues of strains TBCF10839 and PAO1.;  PilY1-immunoreactive bands of predicted size (126 kDa) and similar intensity were detected on immunoblots of PAGE-separated cell lysates from strains PAO1 and TBCF10839 (Fig. 1) suggesting that PilY1 was present in similar amounts in the piliated and the non-piliated strain.;  From left to right: PilY1-immunoreactive signals from planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (126.6 kDa), lane 1; TBCF10839 (126.3 kDa), lane 2; TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 mutant 25C8, lane 3; TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 mutant 10CB5, lane 4; TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 mutant 25C8 complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1, lane 5; and TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5 mutant 14D1, lane 6; grown until late exponential phase.; The strong PilY1-immunoreactive signals of PAO1 and TBCF10839 cell lysates shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from 2 ml of culture.;  RNA was extracted from strain TBCF10839 and its isogenic pilY1 transposon mutant 25C8 grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth to late exponential phase, reverse-transcribed and hybridized onto P. aeruginosa PAO1 GeneChips.;  Values were normalized to the pyocyanin secretion of the TBCF10839 and PA14 wild-type strains respectively. 1, strain PAO1; 2, TBCF10839; 3, TBCF10839 complemented with pME6010 (vector control); 4, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8); 5, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010; 6, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1; 7, PA14; 8, PA14 MAR2xT7 pilY1 mutant ID25263; 9, PA14 MAR2xT7 pilY1 mutant ID25563.;  Thin-layer chromatogram of organic extracts of whole cultures grown to OD578 = 2.5 (A) or grown for 15 h (B) in LB broth of P. aeruginosa strains 1, TBCF10839; 2, PA14; 3, PAO1; 4, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (10CB5); 5, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8); 6, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5; 7, PA14; 8, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (10CB5) complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1; 9, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1; 10, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5 complemented with pME6010::TBpilW; 11, TBCF10839 complemented with pME6010 (vector control); 12, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010; 13, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5 complemented with pME6010.;  Growth of PAO1, PA14 and isogenic TBCF10839 strains at 37°C (1–15): 1, TBCF10839; 2, PAO1; 3, PA14; 4, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8); 5, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (10CB5); 6, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5; 7, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1; 8, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (10CB5) complemented with pME6010::TBpilY1; 9, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5 complemented with pME6010::TBpilW; 10, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (25C8) complemented with pME6010 (vector control); 11, TBCF10839 pilY1::Tn5 (10CB5) complemented with pME6010; 12, TBCF10839 pilW::Tn5 complemented with pME6010; 13, TBCF10839 TBpqsL::Tn5 (insertion of Tn5 at position 541 of pqsL, autolysis induced by the overproduction of HAQs, D'Argenio et al., 2002); 14, TBCF10839 TBphiCTXp40::Tn5 (insertion of Tn5 at position 30 014 in ORF37 of phage ΦCTX (Nakayama et al., 1999), autolysis induced by bacteriophage); 15, TBCF10839 pqsR::Tn5[insertion of Tn5 at position 639 of pqsR (mvfR), transcriptional regulator (Xiao et al., 2006) that induces the expression of the pqsABCDE operon, D'Argenio et al., 2002].

PigX,100621501,17766413,2168757," PigX controlled secondary metabolism by repressing the transcription of the target prodigiosin biosynthetic operon (pigA-pigO).;  Detailed quantitative intracellular proteome analyses enabled the identification of numerous downstream targets of PigX, including OpgG, mutation of which reduced the production of the plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and virulence.;  The highly pleiotropic PigX regulator contains GGDEF and EAL domains with noncanonical motifs and is predicted to be membrane associated.;  Genetic evidence suggests that PigX might function as a cyclic dimeric GMP phosphodiesterase.;  A combination of genetics and proteomic analyses enabled the dissection of pathways mediated by PigX in the control of virulence and secondary metabolism.;  Finally, we show that PigX contains GGDEF and EAL domains and provide genetic evidence that PigX might exert phenotypic effects by functioning as a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE).; The pigX gene encodes a GGDEF/EAL domain protein. (A) Genomic location of pigX, indicating the transcriptional start site (+1) and the insertion sites of transposons (black triangles) in strains HSPIG66 (1), ROP4S (2), and ROP4 (3). (B) Predicted GGDEF/EAL protein domain structure and inner membrane (IM) localization of PigX.;  The primers used, and their restriction sites, were PF120 (EcoRI) and PF121 (HindIII) for the full-length PigX (pTA40), PF120 (EcoRI) and NW148 (PstI) for the N-terminal GGDEF domain (pNRW104), NW147 (EcoRI) and NW148 (PstI) for the GGDEF domain (pNRW105), NW132 (BamHI) and PF121 (HindIII) for the extended EAL domain (pNRW106), NW133 (BamHI) and PF121 (HindIII) for the EAL domain (pNRW107), and finally, NW147 (EcoRI) and PF121 (HindIII) for the GGDEF and EAL domain construct (pNRW108).; To generate two plasmids with amino acid substitution mutations in the EAL domain of PigX (pTA41, ELI→ALI, and pTA48, ELI→AAA), an overlap PCR strategy was used.;  The 649-amino-acid (aa) predicted PigX protein is similar to YhdA from E. coli (64% similarity/54% identity) and is most closely related to the predicted product of ECA0266 from Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043 (80% similarity/73% identity).;  PigX is predicted to have two N-terminal transmembrane helices and a central GGDEF domain (aa 222 to 384), as well as a C-terminal EAL domain (aa 398 to 633) (Fig. ​(Fig.1B).1B).;  Therefore, it was predicted that PigX might be involved in intracellular c-di-GMP metabolism.;  In the intergenic mutant, the transcription of pigX is probably being driven from an internal mini-Tn5lacZ1 promoter (18), resulting in deregulated levels of the PigX repressor, causing decreased Pig production.;  Next, we assessed the effect of PigX on the transcription of pigA-pigO.;  Therefore, the GGDEF/EAL domain protein, PigX, represses the biosynthesis of Pig by decreasing the transcription of the pigA-pigO operon.; PigX represses Pig production by controlling transcription of the Pig biosynthetic operon, pigA-pigO.

(A) Schematic of domain organization of PigX and regions cloned into pQE-80L.;  PL, periplasmic loop. (B) Pig assays of WT and pigX mutant (ROP4) strains in the presence of the PigX plasmids and YahA plasmid shown in panel A.; It was clear that the PigP regulon member PigX was an important secondary metabolite regulator in Serratia strain ATCC 39006 that controlled the transcription of the biosynthetic operon, pigA-pigO.;  To define cellular PigX targets, global proteomic analysis was used to determine the proteins that were altered in abundance in the pigX mutant in comparison to their abundance in the WT strain.;  These proteomic analyses demonstrated that PigX modulates the levels of multiple proteins, the significance of which will be covered in Discussion.;  Interestingly, overexpression of PigX in trans in the pigX mutant repressed the production of Pel (Fig. ​(Fig.4C)4C) but had no detectable effect on Cel (data not shown).;  Therefore, the proteomic, exoenzyme, and virulence data suggest that PigX represses the level of OpgG, which is required for full exoenzyme production and plant pathogenicity in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.; PigX represses Pel activity and virulence in a potato tuber-rotting virulence assay. (A) Pel activities of the WT (LacA), a pigX mutant (ROP4S), an opgG mutant (NW34), and a pigX opgG double mutant (4SOPG) strain.;  Two halos of enzyme activity were observed and are shown as black (inner halo) and white (outer halo). (B) Cel activity of the WT (LacA), a pigX mutant (ROP4S), an opgG mutant (NW34), and a pigX opgG double mutant (4SOPG) strain. (C) Pel activity of the pigX mutant strain plus vector (ROP4 and pQE-80L) and the pigX mutant strain plus PigX (ROP4 and pTA40). (D) Results of potato tuber-rotting assays comparing the amount of rot caused by the WT with the amount caused by the pigX mutant (ROP4S), the opgG mutant (NW34), and the pigX opgG double mutant (4SOPG) strain, using 103 CFU as inocula.; It was of interest to examine whether PigX could be affecting virulence and secondary metabolism by modulating the levels of the intracellular secondary messenger c-di-GMP.;  PigX contains a GGDEF domain with the noncanonical active-site sequence YHSDF instead of the conserved GGDEF motif, which is necessary for the synthesis of c-di-GMP (40, 44) (Fig. ​(Fig.5A).5A).;  Therefore, PigX is unlikely to catalyze the production of c-di-GMP.;  In addition, PigX does not contain the conserved sequence RXXD (X is any amino acid) of the inhibitory c-di-GMP-binding site situated adjacent to the GGDEF motif (10, 32).;  Analysis of the EAL domain of PigX revealed that PigX contains the amino acids ELI (Fig. ​(Fig.5A).5A).;  Our bioinformatic analyses led to the hypothesis that PigX might function (via its EAL domain) as a c-di-GMP-specific PDE.;  Therefore, a genetic strategy was used to determine the possible function of PigX.; Alanine substitution mutants were constructed in the ELI motif, resulting in two plasmids with altered forms of PigX.;  A plasmid with an E424A (ELI→ALI) substitution mutation could partially repress Pig production in a pigX mutant strain, demonstrating that the function of PigX was impaired (Fig. 5A and B).;  These complementation experiments suggested that the ELI motif was essential for the activity of PigX.;  To further examine the roles of the different PigX domains, a series of plasmids was constructed encoding different domains of PigX (Fig. ​(Fig.5A).5A).; To test if the PDE activity of a biochemically characterized EAL protein could function analogously to PigX, the pigX mutant strain was transformed with a plasmid expressing the EAL domain of YahA from E. coli (46) and examined for Pig production.;  These heterologous expression experiments suggest that artificial modulation of c-di-GMP levels can affect secondary metabolism in Serratia strain ATCC 39006 and support the proposed assignment of PigX as a PDE.; The current study has investigated the role of the pleiotropic regulator, PigX, in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.;  PigX controlled diverse phenotypes, including virulence and the biosynthesis of prodigiosin, presumably by functioning as a PDE modulating levels of the intracellular secondary messenger, c-di-GMP.;  Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that PigX has a key role in the regulation of a conditional biosurfactant production and swarming phenotype in Serratia strain ATCC 39006 (N.;  PigX repressed the transcription of the biosynthetic operon pigA-pigO and the production of the red-pigmented secondary metabolite Pig (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2).;  Therefore, bioassay, gene fusion, primer extension, and proteomic experiments showed that PigX repressed (presumably indirectly) the transcription of the Pig biosynthetic gene cluster to control secondary metabolism.; A proteomic strategy was devised to identify cellular changes in the absence of a functional PigX (Fig. ​(Fig.33 and Table ​Table3).3).;  Therefore, although we have speculated about links between specific altered proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and enhanced Pig production in the pigX mutant, it is possible that PigX plays a more general role in the regulation of amino acid metabolism.;  We predicted that PigX (via opgG) may regulate OPG production, membrane integrity, exoenzyme production, and virulence.;  Indeed, Pel production was shown to be repressed by PigX and the pigX mutant was hypervirulent in a potato tuber-rotting model (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).;  Therefore, PigX represses levels of OpgG, which positively influences exoenzyme production and virulence in planta.;  These experiments revealed that, in addition to the alteration in the secondary metabolite production phenotype of a pigX mutant strain, proteins involved in primary metabolism and virulence are also affected, indicating a far more pleiotropic role of PigX than initially thought.;  A number of lines of genetic evidence suggest that PigX functions as a PDE (via its EAL domain) and that levels of c-di-GMP might influence secondary metabolism, exoenzyme production, and virulence in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.;  First, overexpression of a biochemically characterized PDE protein from E. coli affected the PigX-controlled pigment and swarming (data not shown) phenotypes analogously to PigX, implicating altered levels of c-di-GMP in the modulation of Pig biosynthesis and swarming.;  Second, the EAL domain of PigX alone could fully complement Pig production and swarming (data not shown) in the pigX mutant strain.;  Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of the EAL motif of PigX abolished the function of PigX.;  Interestingly, during the preparation of the manuscript it was reported that the PigX homologue YhdA from E. coli (now designated CsrD) was not involved in c-di-GMP signaling and instead may be involved in binding RNA (49).;  In contrast to our results, the authors were unable to complement the yhdA mutant strain with the EAL domain alone, suggesting that YhdA and PigX might not have identical functions (49).; The pleiotropic regulator PigX may be regulated at the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level, which would influence its effects on secondary metabolism and virulence.;  In addition to transcriptional control by PigP, the activity of the PigX protein may be modulated.;  PigX is predicted to be anchored in the inner membrane via two transmembrane-spanning helices (Fig. ​(Fig.1),1), which might enable signal perception leading to an alteration in the activity of PigX.; In conclusion, we have shown that PigX, a GGDEF/EAL domain protein, has phenotypic impacts on virulence and secondary metabolism in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.;  Proteomic analyses enabled the identification of a protein (OpgG), the levels of which were modulated by PigX.;  Despite sequence divergence in the EAL domain, genetic evidence implicated PigX as a PDE, involved in the breakdown of the intracellular secondary messenger c-di-GMP.",

 The pink berries are macroscopic, photosynthetic microbial aggregates composed primarily of two closely associated species: sulfide-oxidizing purple sulfur bacteria (PB-PSB1) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (PB-SRB1).;  Using metagenomic sequencing and 34S-enriched sulfate stable isotope probing coupled with nanoSIMS, we demonstrate interspecies transfer of reduced sulfur metabolites from PB-SRB1 to PB-PSB1.;  Two operational taxonomic units (OTUs), a purple sulfur bacteria (PB-PSB1) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (PB-SRB1), account for more than 60% of the sequences observed.; B. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the full-length PB-SRB1 OTU and related Desulfobulbaceae.; The second most abundant phylotype, PB-SRB1 (15–35% of sequences), is most closely related to Desulfofustis glycolicus, a glycolate-oxidizing sulfate-reducer in the family Desulfobulbaceae (Fig. 2B).;  Uncultured organisms closely related to PB-SRB1 were often found in association with organisms that participate in sulfide-oxidizing symbioses or in environments dominated by sulfide oxidation (either chemotrophic or phototrophic, Fig. 2B).;  For the purposes of this work, we have focused further analysis on the dominant berry phylotypes, PB-PSB1 and PB-SRB1.; PB-SRB1 species was localized via CARD-FISH with a phylotype-specific probe (SRB-PiBe213; this study) designed from the 16S rRNA gene libraries.; Identification of the berry-associated PB-SRB1 species by catalysed reporter deposition–fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) using a phylotype-specific probe.;  Clustering of metagenomic scaffolds (see Experimental procedures) revealed two well-defined bins belonging to PB-PSB1 (20–25× coverage) and PB-SRB1 (15–20× coverage).;  The depth of coverage from these genomic bins corresponded to the abundance ratio of PB-SRB1 to PB-PSB1 observed in the 16S rRNA gene PCR data (1 PB-SRB1 RB per 1.1–1.7 PB-PSB1 cells).;  These genomic bins represent near complete genomes for both PB-SRB1 and PB-PSB1, as assessed by assembled sequence length, number of coding features and an analysis of 45 single copy phylogenetic marker genes (see Supporting Information, Table S1).;  All identified sulfur oxidative genes were found on scaffolds binned to PB-PSB1 by the independent sequence composition-based analysis, while sulfur reductive genes were located on scaffolds in the PB-SRB1 bin.;  Detailed discussion of the oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways in the PB-PSB1 and PB-SRB1 genomes is presented in the Supporting Information S1, Supporting Information S2, Table S2 and Figs S7–12; The pink berries, consortia made up primarily of a purple sulfur bacterial species (PB-PSB1, Chromatiaceae) and putative sulfate-reducing bacterial species (PB-SRB1, Desulfobulbaceae), provide a tractable system to begin decrypting microbial metabolic partnerships that drive sulfur cycling at the microscale.;  Based on the combination of phylogenetic information (i.e. the physiology of these species’ cultured relatives) and the conserved spatial structure of the pink berries, we hypothesized that intraberry sulfate reduction by PB-SRB1 provides a local source of sulfide for PB-PSB1 (Fig. 9).;  Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the genetic potential for this intraberry sulfur cycle; the complete metabolic pathways for sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation were present in the genomes of PB-SRB1 and PB-PSB1 respectively.;  PB-SRB1 (green rods) reduce sulfate to sulfide, oxidizing a variety of electron donors from either exogenous sediment sources or from locally supplied photosynthate produced by PB-PSB1.;  Should PB-PSB1 cells lyse, intracellular sulfur might be reduced and/or disproportionated by PB-SRB1 (grey dashed arrows).;  Some electron donors for PB-PSB1 (HS-) and PB-SRB1 (H2 or fatty acids) are also likely provided exogenously by compounds effluxed from the sediment (squiggly lines).;  Though the PB-SRB1 genome suggests the genetic potential to fix CO2, results from our stable and radiocarbon experiments suggest PB-SRB1 does not contribute significantly to carbon fixation in the berries under the conditions of our incubations.;  Sulfur-34 stable isotope labelling allowed us to follow the flow of sulfur within the aggregate, from the reduction of sulfate by PB-SRB1, to interspecies transfer and incorporation into PB-PSB1 cells.; As direct 34S-sulfate incorporation by PB-PSB1 cells is unlikely, we propose that PB-SRB1 reduced the 34S-sulfate label to sulfide, which was then taken up and re-oxidized to elemental sulfur by PB-PSB1 (Fig. 9).;  The close physical association of PB-SRB1 and PB-PSB1 (Fig. 4) suggests that re-oxidation of reduced sulfur species occurs over very short spatiotemporal scales.; The most likely source of this sulfide detected within the berries is the reduction of sulfate by PB-SRB1.;  However, sulfide could also be produced by several other metabolic processes (Fig. 9), including: (i) reduction of elemental sulfur by PB-SRB1, (ii) disproportionation of elemental sulfur or thiosulfate by PB-SRB1 or (iii) PB-PSB1's dark phase respiration of stored carbohydrates and concomitant reduction of periplasmic elemental sulfur reserves, producing polyhydroxyalkanoates and sulfide (van Gemerden, 1968; Rothermich et al., 2000).;  Large isotopic fractionations, such as those observed in the centre of the berries, can be produced by either (i) slow-growing sulfate-reducing bacteria cultured with refractory or growth-limiting concentrations of electron donors (Sim et al., 2011a,b,; Leavitt et al., 2013), or (ii) step-wise fashion from the coupled metabolic activities of reductive and oxidative processes (e.g. phototrophic sulfide oxidation by PB-PSB1 or intermediate oxidation state sulfur disproportionation by PB-SRB1; see Supporting Information S1 for more detailed discussion of mechanisms that could have produced the observed isotopic gradients).; Cultured relatives of PB-SRB1 in the genera Desulfofustis and Desulfocapsa are capable of both sulfate reduction and the disproportionation of elemental sulfur or thiosulfate (Finster, 2008), corroborating our isotopic findings which suggest disproportionation could contribute to the pink berry sulfide pool.;  Both ecophysiological and genomic data strongly supports the conclusion that PB-SRB1 is capable of sulfate reduction, though genomic evidence for the disproportionation of elemental sulfur or thiosulfate by PB-SRB1 remains less clear.;  The sulfur disproportionation pathway appears to involve many of the same genes used in sulfate reduction, in addition to a sulfite-oxidoreductase enzyme (Frederiksen and Finster, 2003) for which there are several candidates in genomes of PB-SRB1 and D. sulfexigens (Finster et al., 2013).;  Should sulfide reach higher concentrations, disproportionation of polysulfides could become an important portion of the metabolic strategy of PB-SRB1.;  RAST annotations of the PB-PSB1 and PB-SRB1 genomes are available at FigShare (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.770903).;

Sare0718,5704523,22655051,3360062,"In order to investigate cryptic NRP-related metabolites in S. arenicola CNS-205, we cloned and identified the putative gene sare0718 annotated “amino acid adenylation domain”. Firstly, the general features and possible functions of sare0718 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, which suggested that Sare0718 is a soluble protein with an AMP-binding domain contained in the sequence and its cognate substrate is L-Val.;  Then, a GST-tagged fusion protein was expressed and purified to further explore the exact adenylation activity of Sare0718 in vitro.;  By a newly mentioned nonradioactive malachite green colorimetric assay, we found that L-Ala but not L-Val is the actual activated amino acid substrate and the basic kinetic parameters of Sare0718 for it are Km = 0.1164±0.0159 (mM), Vmax = 3.1484±0.1278 (µM/min), kcat = 12.5936±0.5112 (min−1).; By revealing the biochemical role of sare0718 gene, we identified an alanine-activating adenylation domain in marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola CNS-205, which would provide useful information for next isolation and function elucidation of the whole cryptic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-related gene cluster covering Sare0718.;  By analysis of Protparam, Protscale and other programs on the ExPASy server [24], we obtained some detailed information about Sare0718 protein (Accession no.;  YP_001535628): molecular weight at 60.287 kDa, pI at 6.44, and hydrophobicity score between −1.710∼1.557 by which Sare0718 is judged as a hydrophilic protein.;  Besides, an AMP-binding domain (between 89–478 amino acid residues) is found in Sare0718 by SMART [27]. The specificity-conferring code analysis by the online website “PKS/NRPS Analysis Web-site” showed that the signature sequence constituting the substrate-binding pocket of Sare0718 was DMWIAAAIVK and its cognate substrate was L-Val [28]. Finally, with DNAMAN software, we compared the protein homology between Sare0718 and each of the eight terrestrial-derived alanine-activating adenylation domains posted in PKS-NRPS database [29]. As can be seen in Table 2, the protein similarity between Sare0718 and them is just 18.18%∼25.83%.;  M: 1 kb DNA ladder; 1: pGEX-2T-sare0718 digested with BamH I and EcoR I.

(B) Relative activities (substrate specificity) of recombinant Sare0718 for 20 proteinogenic amino acids.;  With various concentrations of Sare0718 (0.0625 µM, 0.125 µM, 0.25 µM, 0.375 µM, 0.5 µM, and 0.625 µM), enzymatic reactions were performed in 96-well plates at 25°C for different times (2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min).;  Using the PPi formation velocity as a function of Sare0718 concentration, we obtained an enzyme concentration curve (Figure 3A).;  It showed that within 5 min, reaction velocity kept a positive linear relationship with Sare0718 concentration and reached its maximum value.;  On the other hand, the time course curve (Figure 3B) was also plotted by using [PPi] (PPi concentration) as a function of reaction time, which suggested that PPi concentration remained a positive linear relationship with reaction time when Sare0718 concentration was within 0.25 µM.;  Then, under Sare0718 cencentration of 0.25 µM and incubation time of 5 min, kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) can be determined by varying the amount of one substrate (alanine: 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.5 mM) and keeping the other reactants (ATP: 0.5 mM) at a saturated concentration.;  By Michaelis-Menten analysis using nonlinear regression (V versus [Ala], see Figure 4), the kinetic parameters of Sare0718 for L-alanine were determined as followings: Km = 0.1164±0.0159 (mM), Vmax = 3.1484±0.1278 (µM/min), kcat = 12.5936±0.5112 (min−1).; To determine the scope of initial reaction velocity, enzymatic reactions (100 µl) containing 0.5 mM alanine, 0.5 mM ATP and different concentrations of purified Sare0718 were performed at 25°C in 96-well plates for various times (2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min). (A) Enzyme concentration curve: reaction velocity versus concentration of Sare0718. (B) Time course curve: concentration of production PPi versus reaction time.;  Sare0718 concentrations in curve 1–6 were 0.0625 µM, 0.125 µM, 0.25 µM, 0.375 µM, 0.5 µM and 0.625 µM, respectively.;  Results presented here suggested that Sare0718 could in vitro specially recognize and activate L-alanine under the consumption of ATP.;  Data indicated that Sare0718 is a soluble protein without signal peptide and transmembrane domain.;  The analysis of conserved domain revealed that an AMP-binding domain is contained within Sare0718 sequence at the 89–478 amino acid residues.;  In our work, with the 20 proteinogenic amino acids as detecting substrates, this facile colorimetric assay was used in 96-well plate to analyze the enzymatic activity of recombinant Sare0718 protein.;  The results showed that Sare0718 was specific to L-alanine over the other proteinogenic amino acids and its basic kinetic parameters for L-alanine were determined as follows: Km = 0.1164±0.0159 (mM), kcat = 12.5936±0.5112 (min−1).;  Nevertheless, examples of codes for which no substrate could be matched or the predicted substrate specificity does not correspond to the actual activated amino acid have been reported [38], [39]. In this work, Sare0718 is just such a special case.;  Before measuring enzymatic activity of Sare0718, we had analyzed its code by the online website “PKS/NRPS Analysis Web-site” [28], which showed that the signature sequence constituting the substrate-binding pocket of Sare0718 was DMWIAAAIVK and its cognate substrate was L-Val.;  However, data presented in this paper indicated that the actual recognized amino acid for Sare0718 was L-Ala.;  On the other hand, the low protein homology between Sare0718 and some other terrestrial-derived alanine-activating adenylation domains (18.18%∼25.83%, see Table 2) also supported the speculation.;  It means that, Sare0718, homologous to “amino acid adenylation domains” of NRPSs, was identified by our experimental data as an alanine-activating adenylation domain but not integrated into a typical NRPS module.;  Here, the stand-alone Sare0718 still needs prospective experiments to investigate its in-depth function in vivo.; In summary, with the 20 proteinogenic amino acids as detecting substrates, we have in vitro identified Sare0718 in S. areniocola CNS-205 as an alanine-activating adenylation domain by a nonradioactive malachite green colorimetric assay.;  It is still worth mentioning that some untested rare amino acids or even a structurally related but unidentified compound might be also activated by Sare0718 since NRPS A domains can often accept non-proteinogenic amino acids, and the in vivo substrate may not be L-alanine.;  Our investigation into the substrate specificity of Sare0718 as described in this paper is useful information in identifying the cryptic NRPS-related gene cluster containing sare0718.;  First of all, molecular weight, pI and hydrophobicity of Sare0718 were analyzed by Protparam, Protscale and other programs on the ExPASy server [24]. Transmembrane region, signal peptide and conserved domain were predicted by program TMHMM Server v. 2.0 [25], SignalP 4.0 [26] and SMART [27], respectively.;  Moreover, the specificity-conferring code and cognate substrate of Sare0718 were analyzed by the online website “PKS/NRPS Analysis Web-site” [28]. Finally, DNAMAN software (http://www.lynnon.com/) was used to compare the protein homology between Sare0718 and each of the eight terrestrial-derived alanine-activating adenylation domains posted in PKS-NRPS database [29].;  The recombinant plasmid bearing DNA encoding Sare0718 protein was verified by sequencing and designated pGEX-2T-sare0718.;  Fresh transformants harboring the Sare0718 construct were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (400 ml started with 1% inoculums from a 10-ml overnight culture) supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin.;  Later, the supernatant (containing GST-Sare0718 fusion proteins) was loaded onto a Glutathione-Sepharose4B column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with affinity buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 0.9% NaCl, 1% Triton X-100).;  At last, protein concentrations were determined with BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), and GST-tag integrated with Sare0718 protein was detected by western blotting analysis.;  I1643), and 0.25 µM Sare0718.;  Each enzyme assay was performed in three different experiments, and for each amino acid, a corresponding negative control (no Sare0718 in the incubation mixture) was also included.;  By comparing relative activities of Sare0718 for the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, its specific substrate can be determined.; The incubation mixtures (100 µl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM alanine, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.4 U/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and various amounts of Sare0718 fusion protein (0.0625 µM, 0.125 µM, 0.25 µM, 0.375 µM, 0.5 µM, and 0.625 µM).;  A standard curve (OD620 versus PPi concentration), by which OD620 can be converted to PPi concentration, was constructed by hydrolyzing different concentrations of PPi in the incubation mixture, except that alanine, ATP, and Sare0718 proteins were omitted.;  Then, optimum incubation time and enzyme concentration for next kinetic assays can be chosen from enzyme concentration curve (reaction velocity versus concentration of Sare0718) and time course curve (concentration of PPi versus reaction time), respectively.; According to the optimum incubation time and Sare0718 concentration determined above, adenylation reactions containing excessive ATP (0.5 mM) and various amounts of alanine (0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, and 0.5 mM) were done at 25°C. [PPi] was measured as described previously in this paper.;  The enzymatic assays were carried out in three independent replications for each alanine concentration (0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, and 0.5 mM, respectively) with a corresponding negative control (no Sare0718 in the incubation mixture).;  Then, the kinetic parameters of Sare0718 for L-alanine were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten model to the above experimental data using nonlinear regression.",

TH,7054,19806188,2751819," The presence of DA exacerbated toxicity because neurodegeneration was attenuated in mutant nematodes depleted for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA production.;  C. Populations of isogenic worm strains expressing GFP exclusively in 5-HT, GABA, ACh, Glut, and DA (+ and –TH) neuronal classes were examined for neurodegeneration.;  The only animals that displayed significant neurodegeneration after six days exposure to S. venezuelae conditioned medium were those in which the DA (+TH) neurons were analyzed (*P<0.01; ANOVA).;  Almost all wild-type DA neurons (+TH) are degenerated after five days of continuous exposure to the conditioned medium.;  A substantial proportion of DA neurons from cat-2 mutant worms (–TH) degenerate as well.;  C. Photomicrographs that capture the same DA neurons (+ and –TH) over the course of several days exposure to the S. venezuelae factor.;  To examine this, we exposed cat-2 (e1112) mutant worms [23] to S. venezuelae conditioned medium. cat-2 worms express reduced levels of TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of DA, and as a result, contain only 40% of wild-type DA levels [24]. After six days of exposure, populations of cat-2 worms (-TH) displayed substantially less degeneration (1%) than wild-type worms with normal levels of DA synthesis (22%) (P<0.001; Fig. 2C).;  Notably, when examining the comparative loss of individual neurons after eight days of exposure to S. venezuelae medium (Fig. 2D), only 3% of DA (-TH) neurons within cat-2 worms exhibited DA neurodegeneration compared with 17% of DA neurons in wild-type worms (P<0.01).;  Notably, in culture, DA neurons degenerate faster when exposed to the S. venezuelae factor; strikingly, 100% of the wild-type DA neuron population (+TH) displayed degenerative changes at day five of continuous exposure while only 60% of the cat-2 DA neurons (-TH) also displayed degenerative changes (Fig. 3B, 3C).;  Support for a “multiple hit” hypothesis for induction of neurodegeneration in PD has recently come from an elegant study indicating that increased cytosolic DA levels influence neurotoxicity through generation of oxidized metabolites that interact with α-synuclein, an effect that is blocked by calcium channel blockers [36]. We previously showed that overexpression of the C. elegans TH homolog, CAT-2, in nematode DA neurons also led to increased neurodegeneration, an effect that was blocked by 3-iodotyrosine treatment (13).;  Given the substantial neuroprotective impact of TH mutants on the toxicity caused by the Streptomyces metabolite in C. elegans, it is interesting to speculate this environmental factor may represent an added multifactoral component in DA neurodegeneration."," The presence of DA exacerbated toxicity because neurodegeneration was

abcg30,827187,19854857,2785968," After two generations, only the Arabidopsis abcg30 (Atpdr2) mutant had significantly altered both the fungal and bacterial communities compared with the wild type using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis.;  Similarly, root exudate profiles differed between the mutants; however, the largest variance from the wild type (Columbia-0) was observed in abcg30, which showed increased phenolics and decreased sugars.;  In support of this biochemical observation, whole-genome expression analyses of abcg30 roots revealed that some genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of secondary metabolites were up-regulated, while some sugar transporters were down-regulated compared with genome expression in wild-type roots.;  Microbial taxa associated with Columbia-0 and abcg30 cultured soils determined by pyrosequencing revealed that exudates from abcg30 cultivated a microbial community with a relatively greater abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (i.e. plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and nitrogen fixers) and were specifically enriched in bacteria involved in heavy metal remediation.; We analyzed the soil microbial community structure supported by Arabidopsis wild type (Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and seven ABC transporter mutants (abca7, abcc2, abcg30, abcg34, abcg35, abcb1, and abcb4; Verrier et al., 2008) grown in Arabidopsis-accustomed soil for two subsequent generations.;  Following the second generation, we found that the ABC transporter mutant abcg30 significantly affected both fungal and bacterial microbial community structure compared with other ABC transporter mutants and the wild type based on an multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis of the entire automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) profile (Fig. 1; Supplemental Table S1).; Based on the ARISA analysis, eight fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased significantly in the soil when abcg30 was grown, compared to the wild type and the negative control (no plant).;  Similarly, 14 bacterial OTUs decreased and four bacterial OTUs increased when abcg30 was grown (Supplemental Fig.;  This result indicates that the other four OTUs (H72, H117, H123, and H129) decreased specifically due to the absence of abcg30.;  Similarly, among the 14 bacterial OTUs that decreased significantly with abcg30, three OTUs (H116, H170, and H241) increased in the negative control compared with the wild type (Supplemental Fig.;  Two other OTUs (H155 and H255) decreased in both abcg30 and the negative control compared to the wild type.;  In addition, four OTUs (H90, H19, H141, and H164) increased significantly in abcg30 compared with the wild type, but one OTU (H90) also increased in the negative control.;  These results suggest that the root exudates of the wild type and the ABC transporter mutant abcg30 might have a different composition of phytochemicals, which impacted the microbial community composition of the native soils.;  The root exudates of abcg30 appeared to be unique (Fig. 2A) and showed the lowest similarity to the wild type (Fig. 2B).;  Compared to the wild type, the following compounds were present in higher concentrations in the root exudates of abcg30: benzoic acid, salicylic acid, syringic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, α-linolenic acid, cyanidin, sinapoyl malate, Val, and indole 3-acetic acid.;  B, Percentage of matched two-dimensional J-resolved signals between wild type (Col-0) and Arabidopsis ABC transporter mutant root exudates. a, Col-0; b, abca7; c, dtx12; d, abcc2; e, abcg30; f, abcg34; g, abcg35; h, abcb1; i, abcb4; j, abcb27.; Based on the comparison of the root exudates profiles of all ABC transporter mutants, we found that abcg30 had increased phenolics and fewer sugars compared to the wild type.;  We hypothesized that the observed differences (phenolics versus sugars) in abcg30 root exudates might not be under the direct control of the ABCG30 transporter but are probably the pleiotropic effects of the mutation.;  To elucidate the pleiotropic effects of abcg30 mutation, we performed whole-genome expression analyses on abcg30 roots compared with wild-type roots using the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array chip.;  Out of 22,810 genes on the chip, 355 (1.5%) genes were up-regulated >1.5-fold, and 156 (0.7%) genes were down-regulated to <0.5-fold in abcg30 compared to the wild type.;  We observed that 10 genes involved in transport, including lipid transporters (At4g22460 and At3g22120) and ABC transporters (At5g44110 and At2g26910), and 16 genes involved in secondary metabolism, including phenylproanoid (At2g23910, At1g65060, and At1g67980) and flavonoid biosnthesis genes (At3g55120, At5g08640, At5g05270, At5g07990, and At5g13930) were up-regulated significantly in abcg30 compared to the wild type.;  Similarly, six genes involved in transport, including sugar transporters (At1g08920 and At4g04760) and a mannitol transporter (At4g36670), and nine genes involved in secondary metabolism, such as terpene biosynthesis (At4g20230, At3g31415, and At5g42600), were down-regulated in abcg30 compared to the wild type.;  In addition to transporters and secondary metabolism biosynthesis genes, we found that some transcription factors and genes belonging to different functional categories, such as primary metabolism, signal transduction, cell growth, and cell division, defense responses and genes of unknown function were also differentially (both up- and down-regulated) expressed in abcg30 compared with the wild type (Supplemental Table S4 and Figure S11).; Due to the differences in phytochemical composition in the root exudates, we examined whether wild-type and abcg30 root exudates affected the in vitro growth of natural Arabidopsis soil microbes using standard serial dilution techniques.;  The abcg30 exudates significantly reduced both the number and growth rate of the fast-growing, culturable soil microbes.;  For example, after 24 h, 2.8 × 107 colonies were visible on Col-0 exudates amended plates, and no colonies were observed on abcg30 exudates amended plates, whereas, at the termination of the experiment (48 h), only 7.1 × 106 colonies could be observed on the abcg30 amended plates, but Col-0 amended plates showed complete bacterial lawns (Supplemental Table S5).; To further characterize the specific taxa associated with abcg30 and wild-type root exudates, we characterized the soil microbial communities after the 2nd generation of plant growth by pyrosequencing of rRNA libraries.;  A total of 160 fungal (Fig. 3A) and 2,489 bacterial (Fig. 3B) sequence reads were obtained from the wild-type and abcg30 soils.;  For example, at a genetic distance of 1%, 84 fungal and 1,661 bacterial OTUs were unique to the abcg30 community, whereas 90 fungal and 1,879 bacterial OTUs were unique to the wild-type community.; Fungal (A) and bacterial (B) OTUs present in the 2nd generation of Atabcg30 and wild-type soils determined by rRNA pyrosequencing.;  Green, abcg30; blue, wild type (Col-0); pink, shared.; From this analysis, the relative abundance of 105 bacterial OTUs differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the wild type and abcg30 (Fig. 4A, B).;  In this study, however, many of the abcg30 up-regulated OTUs appear to be closely related to known PGPRs or otherwise beneficial bacteria.;  A variety of bacteria associated with nitrogen fixation were also up-regulated in the abcg30 soil, including six Brevundimonas spp., two Bradyrhizobium spp. and one Paracoccus sp.;  These include three Brevundimonas spp., one Bradyrhizobium sp., one Lysobacter sp., and one Bacillus sp., which are different OTUs than the ones cultivated by abcg30 based on their genetic distance (>1%) and phylogenetic analysis with their nearest known neighbors (Supplemental Fig.;  Differences were also observed for the fungal community structure in the soils surrounding the wild type and the abcg30 mutant (Fig. 5).;  Additionally, we determined that one Xylella sp. was enriched in the soil cultured by abcg30 compared to wild-type-grown soil, and a similar observation was found for Mycobacterium sp.; Relative abundance of bacterial OTUs (1% dissimilarity) significantly up- (A) or down-regulated (B) in the abcg30 mutant soils compared to the wild type.;  Col-0, black bars; abcg30, gray bars.; Relative abundance of fungal OTUs (1% dissimilarity) significantly down- (A) or up-regulated (B) in the abcg30 mutant soils compared to the wild type.;  Col-0, black bars; abcg30, gray bars.;  In this study, we showed that a single gene mutation (ABC transporter, abcg30) involved in root exudation influences the soil microbial community.;  In this study, we demonstrate that one ABC transporter mutant, abcg30, significantly affects the soil microbial community compared with the wild type.;  The function of abcg30 (also known as Atpdr2) is unknown; however, the organ-specific expression pattern of this gene shows that it is highly expressed in root epidermal cells (Birnbaum et al., 2003; Badri et al., 2008).;  Although abcg30 caused the most dramatic changes in overall microbial composition in the soil compared to the wild type, it should be noted that the other ABC transporter mutants tested in this study generated changes in certain microbial OTUs (data not shown).;  Based on our results and experimental design, we conclude that the observed changes in soil microbial diversity are due to the effect of the plant because (1) no microbial changes in the soil were observed in the control (no plant) from the first to second generation, and (2) significant changes in soil microbial diversity from the first to second generation were observed in abcg30 grown soil but not in the wild type.;  Additional studies are needed to determine the longevity of the abcg30-induced microbial community changes or if the other mutants may eventually significantly alter the microbial community.; We further analyzed the root exudates profiles of seven ABC transporter mutants using two-dimensional NMR analyses and found that abcg30 has increased phenolics and fewer sugars compared to the wild type.;  This result is not in agreement with the previous report by Badri et al. (2008) where abcg30 root exudates did not show significant differences with the wild type and the other ABC transporter mutants based on PCA analysis.;  In both studies, the contributing factors (primary versus secondary metabolites) for PCA analyses were different, which explains why abcg30 root exudates were significantly different from the wild type and other mutants used in this study.; As stated above, a wide variety of compounds exhibited an altered level of secretion in abcg30; however, this does not necessarily mean that secretion of all of these compounds is under the direct control of ABCG30.;  Instead, the pleiotropic effect of the single gene (abcg30) mutation may be linked to the coregulation of metabolic processes or other transport systems.;  Both possibilities were evident in our whole-genome expression analyses, which showed that the genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transporting systems (lipid transporters and ABC transporters) are up-regulated in abcg30 but not in the wild type.;  Conversely, we observed that sugar and mannitol transporters were down-regulated in abcg30 compared with the wild type due to the pleiotropic effect of the gene mutation.;  Because we observed relatively more salicylic acid and sinapic acid in the root exudates of abcg30 compared with the wild type, the use of other gene mutations like sid2 (salicylic acid deficient) and fah1 (sinapate deficient) may provide insight about the role of salicylic or sinapic acids in regulating soil microbial composition.; In vitro serial dilution plating showed that abcg30 root exudates significantly reduced total microbial growth (i.e. colony-forming units).; Pyrosequencing analyses revealed that the abcg30 soil microbial community is enriched with rhizobacteria that may be related to heavy metal remediation, detoxification of toxic chemicals, and nitrogen fixation.;  However, it is clear that the abcg30 soil microbial community is shifting and that the relative abundance of several OTUs closely related to known PGPRs or otherwise beneficial bacteria is increasing.; We hypothesize two possible explanations for the ability of abcg30 to cultivate microbes related to heavy metal remediation and detoxification of toxic chemicals: (1) these microbes are especially adept at utilizing and/or neutralizing the phenolic compounds present in the abcg30 root exudates, and/or (2) the increase in phenolics in the exudates have antimicrobial activity against many of the other bacterial species found in wild-type-grown soil.;  Many bacterial species involved in heavy metal remediation and toxic chemical(s) decontamination can readily utilize phenolic compounds as substrates (Grech-Mora et al., 1996; Kaplan and Kittis, 2004; Vainberg et al., 2006; Kane et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008), such as those secreted by abcg30.;  It is also evident based on the in vitro soil dilution plating results that abcg30 root exudates support a less abundant total microbial community than wild-type root exudates, potentially reducing antagonistic microbe-microbe interactions, which act to suppress some of the OTUs in the wild-type soils.;  Further studies are needed to know how the native soil microbe-induced root exudate profiles of the wild type and abcg30 alter the total soil microbes at the community level.; We also reported that abcg30 appears to culture Xyllela sp. and Mycobacterium sp. compared to the wild type.; Overall, our results show that abcg30 and the resultant ratio and composition of both phenolics and sugars in the root exudates have a profound effect on natural soil microbial composition.;  Because sampling effort (i.e. number of sequence reads) can influence estimates of total species richness, a subset of 160 fungi and 2,489 bacterial sequences were randomly selected and used to create a single library for each of the Atabcg30 and wild-type soils.; A more detailed analysis of the difference between the DOTUR assigned microbial OTUs (1% dissimilarity) in the abcg30 and wild-type soils was conducted as follows: for each OTU, the probability that the OTU relative abundance differed between the abcg30 and wild-type soils was estimated using the statistical test developed by Audic and Claverie (1997).;  Before spreading onto SEA plates, root exudates (1:5, v/v) collected from the wild type (Col-0), abcg30, or a control (MS liquid media) were added to the serial dilutions and incubated for 16 h at 26°C.;  Root exudates were collected by growing wild-type and abcg30 plants in MS liquid media for 30 d on an orbital shaker at 90 rpm and illuminated under cool-white fluorescent light (45 μmol m−2 s−1) with a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark at 25°C.; We used 20-d-old plants raised in liquid culture as described in this study for total RNA extraction from root tissues of both the wild type and abcg30 by using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression-manual.affx).;  Data were analyzed for each of the Atabcg30 replicates with corresponding wild-type replicates.;  Moreover a cutoff value of 1.5-fold change was adopted to discriminate expression of genes that were differentially altered in Atabcg30 compared with the wild type.",

attP,55293,26431970,4644662," We explore here the use of multiple orthologous integrating plasmid systems, based on the int/attP loci from phages TG1, SV1, and ϕBT1, to express the polyketide synthase (PKS) for erythromycin in a heterologous Streptomyces host.;  A further pair of integrating plasmids, both derived from the ϕC31 int/attP locus, were constructed carrying a gene cassette for glycosylation of the aglycone intermediates, with or without the tailoring gene, eryF, required for the synthesis of erythronolide B (EB).;  The integration reaction involves a single DNA crossover between the phage attachment site, attP and the bacterial attachment site, attB, to generate the integrated DNA flanked by the recombinant sites, attL and attR.;  As the excision reaction, in which attL and attR recombine to regenerate attB and attP, can only occur in the presence of the recombination directionality factor (RDF), plasmid vectors based solely on the int/attP locus remain stably integrated (9).;  Recently, two more phage-encoded int/attP loci, from TG1 and SV1, have been described for use in integrating plasmids into Streptomyces genomes (11, 12).;  At the same time, Xue et al. placed the three eryA genes on different plasmids using SCP2* for eryAI and eryAII and the ϕC31 int/attP site for eryAIII (26).; The int/attP region of the phage TG1 was amplified by PCR using TG1 genomic DNA as a template and the primer MS403.; pBF20 (Fig. 2) is an integrating plasmid derived from phage TG1 int/attP and contains the eryAI gene under the control of the actIp promoter and the apramycin-resistant gene (aac(3)IV) for selection. pBF20 is a derivative of pIB023 (see Fig.;  The recombineering procedure of Gust et al. (27) was used to replace all of the DNA from the 3′ end of eryAI to the 3′ end of eryAIII in pIB023 with an overlap extension PCR product encoding aac(3)IV-oriT-TG1 int/attP (34) generated from two PCR products.;  The TG1 int/attP locus was amplified using plasmid pRF10 with the primers PBF20B-for and PBF20B-rev.; Primers PBF20A-for and PBF20B-rev contained 39 nucleotides (nt) of sequence that were identical to the endpoints of the DNA to be retained in pIB023 and were necessary to mediate recombineering between the aac(3)IV-oriT-TG1 int/attP PCR overlap extension product and pIB023 to remove the eryAII and eryAIII genes.; pBF22 is an SV1 int/attP-based integrating plasmid (11) containing the eryAIII gene under the control of actIp promoter and encodes the kanamycin-resistant gene (aphII) for selection (Fig. 2).;  The SV1 int/attP locus was amplified by PCR using pBF3 and the primers PBF22B-for and PBF22B-rev and inserted by In-Fusion cloning into pBF22a cut with XbaI to give plasmid pBF22b.; pBF24 is ϕBT1 int/attP-based integrating plasmid (10) harboring the eryAII gene downstream of the actIp promoter and containing ermE for selection (Fig. 2).;  The oriT (amplified using the template pIJ773 and the primers PBF24E-for and PBF24E-rev) and the ϕBT1 int/attP (amplified using pMS82 as the template and primers PBF24F-for and PBF24F-rev) loci were joined to generate a 2,312-bp fragment by overlap extension PCR, which was inserted by In-Fusion cloning into pBF24C cut with SbfI.; pBF27N is an integrating plasmid encoding the ϕC31 int/attP, derived from a plasmid containing the full angolosamine biosynthesis gene cassette under the control of the actIp promoter (36), a hygromycin-resistant gene (hyg), and oriT (Fig. 2).; The hyg gene encoding hygromycin B phosphotransferase was amplified from plasmid pSMT3-M using the primers PBF27NA-for and PBF27NA-rev and inserted by In-Fusion cloning into pBF27A cut with SspI to form plasmid pBF27B. ϕC31 int/attP locus and oriT were fused by overlap extension PCR; two amplified fragments were prepared using pSET152 as a template and primers PBF27NB-for/PBF27NB-rev and pIB773 as a template and the primers PBF27NC-for/PBF27NC-rev, and the final fused product was obtained using the primers PBF27NC-for/PBF27NB-rev.;  The fragment containing ϕC31 int/attP and oriT (2,410 bp) was inserted into pBF27B cut with SpeI by In-Fusion cloning to produce plasmid pBF27C.;  Finally, the fragment encoding hyg ϕC31 int/attP and oriT was amplified by PCR using the primers PBF27ND-for and PBF27ND-rev and the template pBF27C and inserted using In-Fusion cloning into the SpeI-cut plasmid constructed by Schell et al. encoding the angolosamine biosynthesis cassette (36), thus generating plasmid pBF27N (Fig. 2).;  The integration of pBF22 and pBF23 was confirmed by amplification of a 1,969-bp DNA fragment from the SV1 int/attP region.;  We therefore constructed an integrating plasmid, pBF27N, based on the ϕC31 int/attP locus and encoding the angolomycin biosynthesis gene cassette (Fig. 3), that could be introduced into the Streptomyces strains producing 6-dEB.;  The plasmid containing this gene cassette was modified with the ϕC31 int/attP site and hygromycin marker and introduced into strain expressing 6-dEB, but no glycosylated erythromycin analogues were observed in the fermentation extracts.;  The strategy here was to use four orthogonal integrating vectors based on the Streptomyces phage integrases TG1, BT1, SV1 and ϕC31, each with its cognate attP site.;  The genes encoding eryAI, eryAII, and eryAIII genes were inserted into TG1 int/attP-, SV1 int/attP-, and BT1 int/attP-containing plasmids, respectively, while tailoring genes were inserted into the ϕC31 int/attP-containing plasmid.",

coi1,818581,11402212,111174," The response is mediated by jasmonic acid as shown by lack of IGS induction in the jasmonate-insensitive mutant coi1-1.;  The involvement of the jasmonate signaling in Arabidopsis defense against E. carotovora was indicated by the enhanced susceptibility of the jasmonate-insensitive coi1-1 mutant to this pathogen (Norman-Setterblad et al., 2000).;  The requirement for jasmonate signaling was determined by assessing GS amounts in the coronatine and jasmonate-insensitive mutant coi1-1 (Feys et al., 1994), and for ethylene using the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2-1 (Guzmán and Ecker, 1990).;  In contrast, the jasmonate-insensitive coi1-1 mutant does not show any detectable response (Fig. ​(Fig.4A),4A), suggesting that the response is jasmonate mediated.;  Although the ein2-1 and NahG plants had slightly higher levels of IGS than the wild type, coi1-1 plants showed drastically lowered amounts.;  On the other hand, amounts of 4-MIGS are slightly higher in the coi1-1 mutant and lower in plants carrying the NahG construct.  ;  Three-week-old NahG, ein2-1, and coi1-1 axenic plants were treated on leaves with 2 μL of CF or mock treated with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (control).;  In contrast, no induction of ASA, TSA, and CYP79B3 could be detected in coi1-1 plants, where no IGS induction could be observed.; The lack of CF induction of IGS and the reduced expression of genes involved in Trp/IGS biosynthesis in the coi1-1 mutant indicated that the jasmonic acid pathway played an important role in the regulation of the GS content.;  The coi1-1 mutant did not respond to MeJa and its IGS content remained very low.;  C, RNA gel blots from NahG, ein2-1, and coi1-1 plants were probed with ASA, TSA, and CYP79B3 at different time points after the addition of MeJa or 5 h after mock treatment (C).;  In contrast, no MeJa induction of these transcripts could be observed in the coi1-1 mutant.; Could CF-induced IGS or its degradation products help Arabidopsis to protect itself against invading bacterial pathogens such as E. carotovora? To answer this question we determined the concentrations of Col-0, ein2-1, and coi1-1 extracts, which induce 50% inhibition of bacterial growth (IC50) with or without exogenously added myrosinase.;  Extracts from ein2-1 and wild type were more potent inhibitors of the growth of E. carotovora than coi1-1 extracts with lower GS content.;  This is supported by our previous studies demonstrating that the jasmonate-insensitive mutant coi1-1 exhibits increased susceptibility to E. carotovora infection (Norman-Setterblad et al., 2000) and has a low GS content, as shown here (Fig. ​(Fig.4A).4A).; The regulation of IGS accumulation by MeJa and the low GS content in the coi1-1 mutant may also help to explain the jasmonate-induced resistance toward some fungi and insects (Reymond and Farmer, 1998).;  Thomma et al. (1998) showed that the Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutant is more susceptible to the fungus Alternaria brassicicola than the wild type.;  Moreover, Thomma et al. (1999b) showed that MeJa can boost the level of resistance of the camalexin deficient mutant pad3-1 as well as the wild type, but not of the coi1-1 mutant.;  First, IGS is induced strongly by MeJa and second, the induction of IGS is blocked in the jasmonate signal mutant coi1-1, but not in the ethylene signal mutant ein2-1 or in NahG plants unable to accumulate SA.;  Unlike induction in the wild-type plants, IGS levels and Trp/IGS pathway transcripts do not increase in the coi1-1 mutant after induction by MeJa or CF.;  Moreover, already basal IGS levels are lower in the coi1-1 mutant, demonstrating the requirement for functional COI in IGS regulation.;  However, production of IGS does not rely completely on COI, since coi1-1 plants produce IGS, albeit at lower levels.;  In contrast to IGS, 4-MIGS levels were even slightly higher in coi1-1 than in the wild-type plants (Fig. ​(Fig.4A).4A).;  CS8328, CS8331, and CS3071) and the coi1-1 mutant (Feys et al., 1994) was obtained from J.;  Turner for coi1-1 mutant seeds, Dr.",
crp,20468888,23232715,3520106," We found that crp deletion adversely affected the synthesis of three well-characterized antibiotics in S. coelicolor: actinorhodin (Act), undecylprodigiosin (Red), and calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA).;  Deletion of crp in S. coelicolor leads to dramatic reductions in antibiotic levels, while Crp overexpression enhances antibiotic production.; Previous work on Crp in S. coelicolor has confirmed its ability to interact with cAMP (20), while functional studies have primarily focused on its role in morphological development, as Δcrp mutants have very distinct developmental defects (reduced and delayed germination, small colonies, and accelerated sporulation) (19, 21).; It has been noted previously that S. coelicolor Δcrp mutants produce reduced levels of the blue-pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin (19, 21).;  We constructed a Δcrp mutant in wild-type S. coelicolor strain M145 and observed a similar defect in Act production (Fig. 1A).;  We set out to examine the antibiotic production potential of the Δcrp mutant strain more broadly and compared the levels of Act, Red, and CDA produced by the mutant relative to its wild-type parent.;  A Δcrp mutant strain, however, produced barely detectable levels of Act throughout the same time course (Fig. 1B).;  A similar phenomenon was observed for CDA, where a plate-based bioassay revealed a complete abrogation of CDA production by a Δcrp mutant (Fig. 1C).;  In contrast, Red production profiles during growth in rich liquid medium were similar in both wild-type and Δcrp mutant strains, although a reproducible lag of ~24 h was observed for the Δcrp mutant (Fig. 1D).;  In all cases, both the abundance and timing of antibiotic production could be restored to near-wild-type levels by complementing the crp deletion mutant with a construct carrying crp expressed from its native promoter, confirming that the phenotypes were due to crp deletion (Fig. 1).; Antibiotic production by the wild-type (WT) strain, the Δcrp strain, and Δcrp mutants carrying crp transcribed from its native promoter or the ermE* promoter. (A) S. coelicolor strains grown on rich (R2YE) medium for 4 days. (B to D) The levels of the antibiotics actinorhodin (Act) (B), calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) (C), and undecylprodigiosin (Red) (D) were quantified for these strains grown in liquid culture.; Given the dramatic secondary metabolic defects exhibited by a Δcrp mutant, we wanted to determine the targets of Crp activity in the cell.;  We found that crp was most highly expressed up until 20 h, after which transcripts decreased to levels barely detectable by 36 h.;  We next examined cAMP levels over the time when crp was most highly expressed (12 to 20 h), as cAMP is presumed to be the effector molecule for Crp, based on studies in other bacteria (22–24).;  Interestingly, cAMP levels were more than an order of magnitude higher in the crp mutant than in the wild-type strain (see Fig. S1); enhanced cAMP production has been previously observed for crp mutants in both E. coli (26) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (27).;  We tested the effect of high levels of exogenous cAMP (2 mM) on the behavior of the wild-type strain and found there to be no obvious phenotypic difference between this strain and the one grown without supplementation (data not shown), suggesting that the phenotype of the crp mutant stems from loss of Crp and not from heightened cAMP production.;  As a negative control, parallel assays were conducted using Δcrp mutant cultures.;  The map was created using CGView software (59). (B) Validation of Crp association sites using ChIP assays together with qPCR, before and after crp induction in a Δcrp mutant carrying pIJ6902crp. (C) DNase I footprinting was conducted on three different targets, and a consensus binding site was identified in the protected regions (top panel).; To begin to validate Crp association with select sequences, we constructed a thiostrepton-inducible crp construct and introduced this plasmid into the Δcrp mutant strain.;  We mapped sites upstream of crp itself, SCO4561 and SCO2977, and identified a consensus binding sequence [GTG(N)6GNCAC]; derivatives of this motif could be found in all of the secondary metabolism-associated target sequences, although notably, one-half of the palindrome seemed to be better conserved than the other [GTG(N)6GNGAN] (Fig. 2C; Table 1).;  We opted to follow Crp-dependent effects using an inducible system, where crp was expressed from a thiostrepton-inducible promoter, rather than simply comparing expression patterns of wild-type and mutant strains, as these strains grow very differently (the Δcrp mutant is significantly delayed in germination relative to the wild-type strain).;  RNA samples were prepared from thiostrepton-inducible crp and empty-plasmid control strains, before and after thiostrepton induction, and were analyzed using Affymetrix-based microarrays.;  Genes showing at least a 2-fold change in their expression following induction in the crp-containing samples, but not in the negative control, were regarded as potential targets.;  We cloned the crp gene behind a strong constitutive promoter (ermE*) on an integrating plasmid vector whose target integration sequence is found in all sequenced Streptomyces species examined to date.;  We initially conducted bioassays to compare the antimicrobial production capabilities of these different Streptomyces species carrying either the ermE*-crp construct or the empty vector, using an array of indicator strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis).;  The increased cAMP levels observed in a crp mutant also suggested a repressive role for Crp in cAMP accumulation; however, this also appears to be indirect, as Crp did not associate with sequences near the cya (adenylate cyclase-encoding) gene, nor did Crp induction impact cya expression in our transcriptomic experiments.; An in-frame deletion of crp was created using REDIRECT technology (48), and mutants were confirmed by PCR.;  The Δcrp mutant strain was complemented using the wild-type crp gene, with extended upstream (273-bp) and downstream (284-bp) sequences, cloned into the integrating plasmid vector pIJ82 (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).;  To create a crp-inducible construct, the crp gene was PCR amplified and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) before being subcloned downstream of the tipA promoter in the integrating Streptomyces vector pIJ6902 (see Table S3).;  A constitutive crp overexpression plasmid was made by cloning the crp gene and its downstream sequence immediately downstream of the ermE* promoter in the pMC500 vector (see Table S3), before excising ermE*-crp and inserting it into pIJ82.; To create a Crp overexpression plasmid, the crp coding sequence was PCR amplified (see Table S4 in the supplemental material) and ligated into pET15b (see Table S3).;  To ensure that we were working with cultures grown to similar optical densities (OD), the Δcrp mutant strain was grown for 64 h (this strain exhibits significant delays in germination and very slow vegetative growth) before cross-linking.; For temporal ChIP experiments, cultures of the Δcrp strain (pIJ6902crp) were grown in liquid R5 medium for 16 h, before thiostrepton was added (to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml) to induce crp expression.; Cultures of Δcrp(pIJ6902crp) and Δcrp(pIJ6902) strains were grown as described for the temporal ChIP experiments.;  Semiquantitative PCRs were also conducted as described in reference 56, and we optimized the number of cycles to ensure that amplification was occurring within the linear range of the reaction (28 cycles for crp and 15 cycles for 16S rRNA).; Act and Red production for S. coelicolor M145(pIJ82), Δcrp(pIJ82), Δcrp(pIJ82crp), and M145(pIJ82ermE*crp) strains, grown in liquid R5 medium for 7 days, was quantified spectrophotometrically as described previously (13, 57).;

crp-overexpressing Streptomyces strains and their vector-alone-containing controls were spread on R5 agar medium and incubated for 3 and 7 days.; Spores of the wild-type, Δcrp, Δcrp(pIJ6902crp), and Δcrp(pIJ6902) strains were pregerminated and cultured in liquid R5 medium.;  For the wild-type strain, samples were harvested at 12, 16, 20, and 24 h, while for the Δcrp(pIJ6902crp) strain, cultures were induced at 16 h and samples were harvested at 16 (preinduction), 18, 20, and 24 h.;  Cultures of the negative controls, the Δcrp and Δcrp(pIJ6902) strains, were set up 48 h ahead of the wild-type and Δcrp(pIJ6902crp) strains, respectively, and were then followed using the same time course.;

To answer this question we determined the concentrations of Col-0, ein2-1, and coi1-1 extracts, which induce 50% inhibition of bacterial growth (IC50) with or without exogenously added myrosinase.;  Extracts from ein2-1 and wild type were more potent inhibitors of the growth of E. carotovora than coi1-1 extracts with lower GS content.;  The response is independent of ethylene, because ein2-1 can also be protected by pre-treatment with MeJa (Thomma et al., 1999a).;  First, IGS is induced strongly by MeJa and second, the induction of IGS is blocked in the jasmonate signal mutant coi1-1, but not in the ethylene signal mutant ein2-1 or in NahG plants unable to accumulate SA.;  Such interference is suggested by results with the ein2-1 mutant blocked in ethylene signaling.;  The induction of IGS was even slightly elevated in the ein2-1 mutant in comparison with the wild type.;  The slightly higher basal IGS levels in ein2-1 may be due to the higher values of free jasmonic acid in this mutant (Penninckx et al., 1998).;  The Arabidopsis mutants trp2-8 (Barczak et al., 1995), trp3-1 (Radwanski et al., 1996), and ein2-1 (Guzmán and Ecker, 1990) were obtained from the Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH; accession nos.;  John Ryals for seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis carrying the NahG gene, and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH) for providing the ein2-1 and the Trp pathway mutants."," Three-week-old NahG, ein2-1, and coi1-1 axenic plants were treated on

esi,5266,28535774,5442856,"We identified a transcription regulator Esi for the biosynthesis of epothilones.;  Inactivation of esi promoted the epothilone production, while overexpression of the gene suppressed the production.;  However, the Esi regulation is not universal in myxobacteria, because the esi gene exists only in a few myxobacterial genomes.; Esi binds to the epothilone promoter and down-regulates the transcriptional level of the whole gene cluster to affect the biosynthesis of epothilone.;  This is the first transcription regulator identified for epothilone biosynthesis.;  The production of secondary metabolites in microorganisms is normally limited, probably due to the complex and mostly-unknown network of global and pathway-specific regulators, as well as the large biosynthetic gene cluster containing many gene modules [1–4]. Myxobacteria are able to produce diverse secondary metabolites [5–8]. Although a dozen gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites have been reported in myxobacteria, a few regulation factors have been identified.;  StiR is the first regulator identified for secondary mechanism in myxobacteria, which was found involving in the positive regulation of stigmatellin production in Cystobacter fuscus Cb f17.1 [9]. ChiR was found to serve as a pleiotropic regulator, which not only positively regulated the chivosazol biosynthesis, but also affected the fruiting body development in Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 [10]. NtcA, a famous global transcriptional regulator responsive to the concentration of nitrogen, was reported to be able to regulate the biosynthesis of chivosazol and etnangien negatively in S. cellulosum So ce56 [11].; Epothilones are originally produced by some strains of S. cellulosum, and are a group of antitumor compounds mimicking paclitaxel in the polymerization of tubulin [6, 12]. Epothilones are potential anticancer agents by their greater water solubility and efficacy against paclitaxel-resistant tumors [13, 14]. Researchers tried many methods to improve the epothilones yield, including co-cultivation of different strains [15], mutation and high-throughput screening of high-producing strains [16], immobilization of strains [17], heterologous expressions [18–24] and manipulation of related genes [25, 26]. However, the yield is still limited.; 
Sorangium cellulosum So0157-2 is an epothilone producing strain [35]. We previously sequenced the genome of So0157-2 [36], studied in details the characteristics of epothilone operon promoter in Escherichia coli (E. coli) [37], and randomly integrated the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster into M. xanthus genome by transposition [22]. In this study, we reported the identification of a negative transcription regulator for the biosynthesis of epothilones.; Using the conjugation and subsequent homologous recombination protocols as previously described [38], we inactivated genes flanking the epothilone gene cluster in S. cellulosum So0157-2 to determine whether they were associated with the synthesis, regulation or modification of epothilones.;  The gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis, which was confirmed by amplification using Tail-PCR and sequencing of the insertion region.

After 7 days of shaking cultivation, the resin was harvested, and the absorbed compounds were extracted for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to determine the yields of epothilones.;  The results suggested that the SCE1572_25030 gene probably encoded an epothilone synthesis inhibitor (Esi).;  The mutant strain was termed as So0157-2-esi
−.; Due to the genetic manipulation difficulty in S. cellulosum cells, we investigated influences of the esi gene on the production of epothilones in M. xanthus.;  We previously integrated the So0157-2 epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster randomly into M. xanthus genome by transposition; and the esi gene upstream to the epothilone gene cluster was also included in the transferred fragment [22]. We chose the ZE9 transformant derived from M. xanthus DZ2 for the assay.;  Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there was no homologous sequence of esi in DZ2, which was further confirmed by PCR amplification of an esi fragment against the DZ2 genome.;  Firstly, we deleted the esi gene from ZE9, producing the knockout mutant ZE9Δesi.;  The ZE9 and ZE9Δesi strains had similar growth curves in CYE medium (Fig. 2a).;  After 6 days of incubation, the yields of epothilones A and B increased 72.4 and 24.2%, and the total yields of epothilones were 9.9 mg/L in ZE9 and 13.7 mg/L in ZE9Δesi, respectively (Fig. 2b).;  The deletion of esi significantly increased the production of epothilones in Myxococcus cells (t test, p value <0.01).
; Furthermore, we constructed an esi-overexpressing mutant strain ZE9 att::esi by using plasmid pSWU30-p630-esi to introduce an additional esi gene into the attB site of ZE9 genome.;  The results showed that the ZE9 att::esi and ZE9 att::Tet strains also had a similar growth curve as the ZE9 strain (Fig. 2a).;  However, the introduction of an additional esi gene obviously suppressed the epothilone production (9.9 mg/L in ZE9 vs. 5.5 mg/L in ZE9 att::esi; t test, p value <0.01), whereas the ZE9 att::Tet had a similar epothilone yield as ZE9 (t test, p value >0.05) (Fig. 2b).; To investigate the regulation mechanism of Esi on the production of epothilones, we comparatively analyzed the transcriptional levels of epothilone biosynthetic genes in the esi-deletion and overexpression mutants with their parent strain M. xanthus ZE9 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).;  In ZE9 strain, compared with the expression of the epoA gene, the esi gene expressed at a low level (Fig. 3).;  In the early growth stage (24 h of incubation), expression of the esi gene was approximately 21% of the epoA gene; then weakly decreased with the increase of incubation.;  After the growth, the expression level of esi gene was greatly decreased, remaining less than 2% of the 24 h-expression at the 60 h of incubation (the stable stage of the growth curve, referred to Fig. 2b).;  Comparatively, in the ZE9 att::esi mutant, the additional esi gene was under the control of the 630-bp promoter of pilA, which held the total expression level of esi at high levels.;  The esi expressions at the 24, 48 and 60 h were 4.35-, 3.16- and 2.70-fold of that at the 24 h in the ZE9 strain (Fig. 3).
; RT-qPCR analysis of expressions of the esi gene and the seven epothilone ORFs in the ZE9, ZE9 ∆esi and ZE9 att::esi strains after 24, 48 and 60 h of incubation in CMO medium.; After the deletion of the esi gene, the transcriptional level of each of the seven epothilone ORFs was markedly up-regulated at different incubation time points (t test, p value <0.05 or p value <0.01) (Fig. 3).;  However, with the overexpression of esi, the epothilone genes were correspondingly down-regulated in the ZE9 att::esi strain (Fig. 3).; It is known that the repression of transcription initiation often occurs simply by steric hindrance [29]. From the above results, we suggested that the esi protein product probably functioned by directly binding on the epothilone promoter sequence to block the transcription.;  According to the quality assessment by Ramachandran plot (Additional file 1: Figure S1), the accuracy of protein structural models (80.6% of the residues in favored region) was acceptable [40].
;  To determine the molecular mechanism of Esi regulation on the epothilone synthesis, we assayed the binding activity between Esi and the 17-bp operator DNA sequence of epothilone promoter.;  We constructed the esi gene into the expression vector pET-28a, forming pET-28a-esi, which was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.;  These genomes contained single esi gene copy, except Pseudomonas fluorescens FW300-N2C3, which contained two genes encoding for the Esi homologous proteins.;  The esi gene distributed mainly in Pseudomonas (143 of the 203 genomes), Acinetobacter (41 genomes) and Burkholderia (6 genomes).;  Surprisingly, among more than 20 sequenced myxobacterial genomes, the esi gene was only found in the Stigmatella aurantiaca strain DW4/3-1 and the S. cellulosum strains So0157-2 and So0163.; All of the Esi proteins had a length ranging from 356aa to 419aa, and their functions have not been reported, indicating that the esi gene codes a novel negative regulator.;  The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid residue in the Esi homologue proteins was calculated using ConSurf [41], which showed that the C-terminal domain had the highest conservation, followed by the N-terminal domain and the linker region (Additional file 3: Figure S2).; In this paper, we determined that the Esi protein played as a transcription regulator for epothilone biosynthesis.;  Inactivation of esi gene markedly promotes epothilone production.;  The Esi binds, probably via the N-terminus of the protein, to the inverted repeat of epothilone promoter and down-regulates the transcription of each gene in the gene cluster to suppress epothilones synthesis.;  This is the first transcription regulator identified for the biosynthesis of epothilones.;  The Esi protein connected with an operator of the promoter for the biosynthesis of epothilones, and the operator sequence contained a 4-bp inverted repeat in a 17-bp DNA fragment.; Inactivation of esi was performed by insertion mutation.;  Using genomic DNA of So0157-2 as template, the homologous arm was amplified by PCR with primers esi F1 and esi R1.;  The PCR fragment was phosphorylated with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Fermentas, Canada) and then cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pCC11 [38], leading to the insertion plasmid pCC-esi.;  After verification by DNA sequence analysis, the pCC-esi was transformed into E. coli DH5α (λ pir) harbouring the pRK2003(Kmr)plasmid, the resulting strain containing double plasmids was designed as ET-esi.;  The transformation of the plasmid pCC-esi into the genome of the So0157-2 was performed by biparental mating and conjugation, as described previously [38]. The E.coli ET-esi and So0157-2 were mixed with a ratio of 1:50, inoculated on the nitrocellulose membrane on VY/2 plate (7 μg/mL of Gm, 5 μg/mL of Cm), incubated for 40 h and then transferred to the selection VY/2 plate (15 μg/mL of Gm, 3 μg/mL of Cm).;  A Genome Walking kit (TaKaRa, Japan) was used to amplified the flanking sequence of insertion sites with three specific primers, Cm1, Cm2 and Cm3, designed in this work and a random primer AP1 provided by the kit.; 
Myxococcus xanthus ZE9 was constructed with inserting the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster and some flanking sequence, including the esi gene, into the genome of DZ2 by transposition in previous work [22]. The deletion of esi gene was performed by construction of knockout vector pBJ-esi.;  The arms for homologous recombination were amplified from the genome of So0157-2 by PCR using the primers esi-up F and esi-up R for upstream arm and esi-down F and esi-down R for downstream arm.;  The 1.6-Kb fragment of esi-ud was amplified by overlap PCR with esi-up mixed with esi-down as template and the primers esi-up F and esi-down R, digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and then cloned into pBJ113, constructing the knockout vectors pBJ-esi.;  The pBJ-esi was introduced into ZE9 by electroporation as described previously [22]. Resistant colonies that appeared after 6 days of incubation on CYE plates with 40 μg/mL of Km were checked by colony PCR with primers KG-test F and KG-trst R.;  The Km-resistant colonies were resuspended in 2.5 mL-tube with CYE liquid medium and diluted in gradient for 102–105 times, mixed with 2.5 mL of 0.5% soft agar and the mixture were spread on CYE selection agar plates containing 0.1% galactose to select the second recombination event.;  The galactose-resistant but Km-sensitive colonies were screened and checked by colony PCR with primers Esi-up F and Esi-down R.;  The knockout mutant, designated as ZE9∆Esi, was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products.;  The 1.2-Kb esi gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of So0157-2 by PCR with the primers esi F2 and esi R2 and ligated into XbaI and KpnI sites of pSWU30-p630 to produce the overexpression vector pSWU30-p630-esi.;  The pSWU30-p630-esi was electroporated into ZE9 and Tet-resistant colonies were screened by colony PCR using the primer p630 F and esi R2.;  We analyzed the relative transcriptional level of the esi gene and epothilone gene cluster by RT-qPCR on LightCycler® 480 (Switzerland) with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ GC Dye (Takara, Japan).; So0157-2 and So0157-2-Esi− were cultured in M26 medium (8 g/L potato starch, 2 g/L soy peptone, 2 g/L glucose, 2 g/L yeast powder, 1 g/L MgSO4, 1 g/L CaCl2, 1 mL/L EDTA-Fe3+, 1 mL/L microelement, pH 7.2) for 3 days and inoculated into 50 mL of EPM medium (4.7 g/L dextrin, 1.7 g/L soybean cake powder, 0.8 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L saccharose, 2.2 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L CaCl2, 2 mL/L EDTA-Fe33+, 1 mL/L corn steep liquor, 1 mL/L microelement, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2% of resin XAD 16 for the absorbtion of epothilone products.;  ZE9 and esi mutants were grown overnight in 50 mL of CYE medium supplemented with Apra (30 μg/mL).;  The cultures were inoculated at a ratio of 2:100 into 50 mL of CMO medium containing 2% of the XAD-16 resin.;  The resin were harvested with strainer after 9 days (for S. cellulosum) and 6 days (for M. xanthus) and extracted with 3 mL of methanol by shaking at room temperature overnight [16]. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm and filtered with 0.22 µm filter to remove the impurities. 20 μL of the sample was injected into High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, SHIMADZU, Japan) and analyzed on a Shim-pack MRC-ODS RP C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 4.60 μm; Shimadzu, Japan) and monitored at 250 nm, with a mobile phase of 60% of methanol (HPLC grade) and 40% of H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.;  A multiple sequence alignment of the Esi protein and its homologous proteins was established using the MAFFT program [58]. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid positions in the Esi protein and its homologous sequences was estimated by using ConSurf algorithm [41]. The JTT substitution matrix was used and the computation was based on the empirical Bayesian paradigm.; Expression vector was constructed by amplifying the esi gene fragment, fused with a His-tag at N-terminus, with PCR using the primers of esi F3/esi R3 and ligating it into the XbaI and KpnI sites of the plasmid pET-28a, generating pET-28a-esi.;  E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with plasmid pET-28a-esi.;  After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight with Ni–nitrilotriacetic acid HiszBind resin (Novagen), and then eluated with Lysis Buffer containing gradient imidazole ranging from 20 to 250 Mm to collect soluble purified Esi protein.;  The reaction samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then loaded into a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel to conduct electrophoresis with TGE buffer (14.3 g/L glycine, 3 g/L Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 2.5 h at 10 mA and 4 °C.; XJY, ZFL and YZL designed the experiments.",

lysozyme,4069,28931063,5607194," However, flavones exhibited synergy against P. aeruginosa in the presence of antibiotics or recombinant human lysozyme.; Because many innate defense proteins secreted by the airway epithelium act in part through bacterial lysis or permeabilization (e.g. lysozyme [62–67] and β-defensins [68–71]), we sought to test whether flavones may enhance the efficacy of airway antimicrobials.;  We tested the effects of flavones combined with the important airway antimicrobial lysozyme, which is secreted by airway submucosal gland serous cells [72–74] and catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall [75, 76]. We focused on P. aeruginosa, as it appeared to be the most sensitive to flavone effects among the pathogens tested here.;  While lysozyme is more effective against gram-positive bacteria, it does have effects against gram-negative bacteria.;  In the presence of EDTA to help disrupt the outer lipopolysaccharide-containing gram-negative layer, rapid lysis is observed with lysozyme treatment at low ionic strength [76, 77]. Rapid lysis of P. aeruginosa (decrease in OD600) was observed in the presence of recombinant human lysozyme ± flavones (Fig 3A–3C).;  While individual flavones (apigenin, chrysin, and wogonin) caused minimal lysis under these conditions and did not enhance lysozyme-mediated lysis, a mixture of these flavones (100 μM each) promoted lysis approximately 50% as well as lysozyme after 2 hrs. (Fig 3C).;  Moreover, the flavone mixture significantly enhanced lysozyme-mediated P. aeruginosa lysis (Fig 3B and 3C).; (A) Traces of planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of flavones ± lysozyme.;  Note the greatest OD600 decrease (bacterial lysis) occurred with lysozyme and flavone mix combined. (B) Bar graphs of the initial OD decrease rate (OD600 units/min) from A (n = 3–6 experiments for each condition). (C) Bar graphs showing ΔOD600 after 2 hours from A.;  After exposure to lysozyme ± flavones for 10 min, cells were centrifuged and supernatant was collected for measurement of fluorescence.;  Neither 300 μM apigenin nor 300 μM chrysin significantly increased lysozyme-mediated lysis (Fig 4), supporting that there is a synergistic effect of mixing flavone compounds.; Bar graph showing normalized fluorescence (control = 1) from PAO-GFP cultures incubated in lysozyme lysis buffer with addition of lysozyme and/or flavones as indicated and described in the text.;  Synergistic effects of the flavone mixture were observed both alone and combined with lysozyme.;  NPN is a hydrophobic fluorophore that undergoes a quantum yield increase upon transition from a hydrophilic aqueous environment to a hydrophobic phospholipid environment [78], and NPN uptake is frequently used to measure gram-negative outer membrane permeabilization [78–82]. A flavone mix enhanced NPN uptake alone or in combination with lysozyme greater than an equal amount of individual flavones, as found above (Fig 5).; Bacteria were incubated for 5 min with lysozyme ± flavones as indicated and described in the text, followed by measurement of NPN fluorescence, reflecting uptake of NPN into the bacterial phospholipid membrane.; To determine if the effects observed above with recombinant lysozyme translated to enhancement of physiological antimicrobials secreted by airway epithelial cells, we tested the ability of flavones to enhance the antimicrobial activity of Calu-3 cell secretions.;  Calu-3 cells are a model of airway secretory cells [72], resembling some aspects of both submucosal gland serous cells (e.g. secretion of lysozyme [83] and β-defensins [84]) as well as surface epithelial goblet cells (e.g. secretion of Muc5AC [85, 86]).; Here, we found specifically that a mixture of flavones can enhance the bacteriolytic activity of recombinant human lysozyme against a common gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa, and flavones can enhance the bactericidal activity of endogenous human respiratory cell secretions, of which lysozyme is a major component [65, 83, 89, 90]. Together with our previous study [32], our data suggest flavone compounds might modulate respiratory innate immunity through multiple mechanisms (Fig 7).;  Lysozyme lysis assays were conducted essentially as described [76, 77, 96]. Bacteria were washed and resuspended (OD 0.5) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 with recombinant human lysozyme ± flavones before monitoring OD600 between incubations at 37°C.;  For GFP release assays, lysozyme lysis experiments were carried out as above in 1 mL volume; after 10 min, samples were centrifuged to pellet bacteria (10,000 g for 15 min) and supernatant GFP fluorescence was measured on a Tecan Spark 10M plate reader (485 excitation, 535 emission).;  Background was estimated by measuring lysis buffer alone and was subtracted from each experimental value before normalization to control conditions (supernatant from cells in lysis buffer alone, no lysozyme).",
mBF,170799,28722830,6638155,"After invasion into intercellular spaces of tomato plants, the soil‐borne, plant‐pathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum strain OE1‐1 forms mushroom‐shaped biofilms (mushroom‐type biofilms, mBFs) on tomato cells, leading to its virulence.;  To analyse the function of ralfuranones in mBF formation by OE1‐1 cells, we observed cell aggregates of R. solanacearum strains statically incubated in tomato apoplast fluids on filters under a scanning electron microscope.;  The ΔralA strain formed significantly fewer microcolonies and mBFs than strain OE1‐1.;  Supplementation of ralfuranones A, B, J and K, but not L, significantly enhanced the development of mBF formation by ΔralA.;  Furthermore, a phcB‐ and ralA‐deleted mutant (ΔphcB/ralA) exhibited less formation of mBFs than OE1‐1, although a QS‐deficient, phcB‐deleted mutant formed mBFs similar to OE1‐1.;  Supplementation with 3‐OH MAME significantly reduced the formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA.;  The application of each ralfuranone significantly increased the formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA supplied with 3‐OH MAME.;  Together, our findings indicate that ralfuranones are implicated not only in the development of mBFs by strain OE1‐1, but also in the suppression of QS‐mediated negative regulation of mBF formation.;  Following the invasion of the intercellular spaces of tomato plants, strain OE1–1 forms mushroom‐shaped biofilms (mushroom‐type biofilms, mBFs) on the surfaces of tomato cells adjacent to intercellular spaces, leading to the colonization of intercellular spaces (Hikichi, 2016; Hikichi et al., 2017; Mori et al., 2016).;  Therefore, mBF formation on tomato cells after invasion of the intercellular spaces is essential for the virulence of R. solanacearum on tomato plants.;  Interestingly, the observation of cell aggregates of R. solanacearum strains incubated on filters under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) suggests that the apoplast fluids from tomato plants are better than xylem fluids for mBF formation by strain OE1–1 (Mori et al., 2016).;  Bacterial biofilms often consist of mushroom‐shaped complex multicellular structures (Klausen et al., 2003), similar to mBFs produced by R. solanacearum strain OE1–1 (Mori et al., 2016).;  Although ralfuranones are implicated in the productivity of the major EPS, EPS I, and cell aggregation by strain OE1–1 (Mori et al., 2017), the involvement of ralfuranones in mBF formation after invasion of intercellular spaces, which is required for R. solanacearum virulence, remains unknown.;  Because these analyses implicated ralfuranones in the colonization of OE1–1 in intercellular spaces, we then analysed mBF formation by R. solanacearum strains incubated in tomato apoplast fluids on filters using a SEM.; Previously, we have observed mBFs produced by R. solanacearum strain OE1–1 incubated in tomato apoplast fluids on filters under a SEM (Mori et al., 2016).;  Ralstonia solanacearum strain OE1–1 produced microcolonies (Fig. S2b), immature mBFs (Fig. S2c) and mature mBFs (Fig. S2d).;  We then compared the numbers of microcolonies, immature mBFs and mature mBFs of OE1–1 cells incubated in tomato apoplast fluid on filters for 24 or 32 h.;  Although the numbers of immature mBFs and mature mBFs of OE1–1 cells incubated for 32 h were increased slightly compared with those for 24 h, there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05).;  Although we observed collapsing mBFs when incubated for 42 h, no collapsing mBFs were observed when incubated for both 24 and 32 h (data not shown).;  As a result of this work, we chose to investigate mBF formation in apoplast fluids on filters after 24 h.; The numbers of microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter, immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter and mature mBFs of >10 μm in diameter produced by cells of Ralstonia solanacearum strain OE1–1 incubated in tomato apoplast fluid on nano‐percolators for 24 or 32 h.; During biofilm formation, cells of strain OE1–1 first attach to the surface and then produce flat microcolonies followed by mBFs (Mori et al., 2016).; The ΔralA mutant formed significantly fewer microcolonies (Fig. ​(Fig.3a)3a) and immature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.3b)3b) than OE1–1 and ralA‐comp (P < 0.05; Table S1, see Supporting Information).;  The ΔralA mutant formed few mature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.3c).3c).;  However, the numbers of mature mBFs produced by the ralA‐comp strain did not differ significantly from those produced by OE1–1 (P > 0.05, Fig. ​Fig.3a,3a, Table S1).; Influence of ralfuranones on the formation of microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter (a), immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter (b) and mature mBFs of >10 μm in diameter (c) by Ralstonia solanacearum strains.;  We analysed mBF formation by ΔralA supplemented with ralfuranones A, B, J, K or L at a concentration of 20 μm.;  However, the application of ralfuranones A, B, J or K resulted in significantly increased formation of both immature mBFs (P < 0.05, Fig. ​Fig.3b,3b, Table S1) and mature mBFs (P < 0.05, Fig. ​Fig.3c,3c, Table S1) by the ΔralA strain, whereas 20 μm of ralfuranone L increased slightly the formation of mature mBFs by the ΔralA strain (Fig. ​(Fig.3c,3c, Table S1).;  We therefore analysed the formation of mBFs by a phc QS‐deficient mutant (phcB‐deleted mutant ΔphcB) (Kai et al., 2015).;  The numbers of microcolonies (Fig. ​(Fig.4a),4a), immature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.4b)4b) and mature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.4c)4c) produced by the ΔphcB mutant did not differ significantly from those produced by OE1–1 (P > 0.05; Table S2, see Supporting Information).;  However, a phcB‐ and ralA‐deleted mutant (ΔphcB/ralA) produced significantly fewer microcolonies and mature mBFs than strains OE1–1 and ΔphcB (P < 0.05).; Influence of phc quorum sensing (QS) on the formation of microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter (a), immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter (b) and mature mBFs of >10 μm in diameter (c) by Ralstonia solanacearum strains.;  We analysed the formation of mBFs by the ΔphcB/ralA mutant supplied with 3‐OH MAME at a concentration of 100 nm.;  The application of 3‐OH MAME resulted in a significantly reduced formation of microcolonies (Fig. ​(Fig.4a),4a), immature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.4b)4b) and mature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.4c)4c) by ΔphcB/ralA (P < 0.05, Table S2).; We then analysed the formation of mBFs by the ΔphcB/ralA mutant supplied with 3‐OH MAME at a concentration of 100 nm and ralfuranones A, B, J, K or L at a concentration of 20 μm.;  The additional application of each ralfuranone significantly enhanced the formation of microcolonies (Fig. ​(Fig.5a),5a), immature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.5b)5b) and mature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.5c)5c) by ΔphcB/ralA supplied with 3‐OH MAME (P < 0.05; Table S3, see Supporting Information).;  In particular, ΔphcB/ralA supplied with both 3‐OH MAME and ralfuranones J or K formed significantly more mBFs than strain OE1–1 (P < 0.05).; Effect of phc quorum sensing and ralfuranones on the formation of microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter (a), immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter (b) and mature mBFs of >10 μm in diameter (c) by Ralstonia solanacearum strains.; We then analysed the formation of mBFs by ΔepsB. ΔepsB produced significantly more microcolonies (Fig. ​(Fig.7a)7a) and immature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.7b)7b) than strain OE1–1 (P < 0.05).;  However, ΔepsB produced mature mBFs at a similar level to strain OE1–1 (Fig. ​(Fig.77c).; Influence of exopolysaccharide I (EPS I) on the formation of microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter (a), immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter (b) and mature mBFs at >10 μm in diameter (c) by Ralstonia solanacearum strains.;  Furthermore, the observation of mBF formation by R. solanacearum strains using the in vitro mBF formation system showed the involvement of ralfuranones in the development of mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.3),3), but not in the attachment of strain OE1–1 cells (Fig. S3).;  Therefore, the many functions of ralfuranones in the infection route of OE1–1 may lead to the formation of mature mBFs on host cells after invasion into intercellular spaces, systemic infectivity and bacterial cell aggregation in xylem vessels, contributing to OE1–1 virulence.;  The results in this study showed the involvement of ralfuranones in mBF formation (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3).;  Mature mBFs produced by strain OE1–1 can dissolve, releasing cells from the mBF (Mori et al., 2016).;  It is thus thought that OE1–1 cells released from mature mBFs can invade xylem vessels.;  Interestingly, deficiency of EPS I productivity by epsB deletion led to the enhanced formation of microcolonies and immature mBFs, but did not affect significantly the formation of mature mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.7).7).;  It is thus thought that EPS I may be directly involved in cell aggregation but not the development of mature mBFs by strain OE1–1 (Fig. S4, see Supporting Information).;  The reduced formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA relative to strains OE1–1 and ΔphcB, and the significantly reduced formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA with application of 3‐OH MAME, suggest that phc QS may negatively regulate mBF formation in the absence of ralfuranones (Fig. ​(Fig.4;4; Table S1).;  The formation of immature and mature mBFs by ΔralA supplemented with ralfuranone A, B, J or K (Fig. ​(Fig.5b,c)5b,c) suggests the involvement of these ralfuranones in the development of mBF formation (Fig. S3; Table S2).;  Furthermore, the co‐application of ralfuranone A, B, J, K or L increased the formation of not only mBFs, but also microcolonies, by ΔphcB/ralA supplemented with 3‐OH MAME (Fig. ​(Fig.5;5; Table S2), suggesting that ralfuranones A, B, J, K and L (especially J and K) may suppress the phc QS‐mediated negative regulation of mBF formation.;  It is thought that a change in production of ralfuranones J and K from ralfuranone B by OE1–1 may especially contribute to all stages during mBF formation.;  RS‐IIL is required for the attachment ability of strain OE1–1 to the surface of plant cells, leading to the formation of mBFs (Mori et al., 2016).;  In this study, ralfuranones A, B, J and K, whose production is induced through phc QS, contributed to both the formation of microcolonies and the development of mBFs (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3).;  Furthermore, strain OE1–1 formed mature mBFs during incubation for 24 h (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2).;  Therefore, integrated signalling via not only RS‐IIL, but also ralfuranones, whose production is dependent on phc QS, is implicated in mBF formation by R. solanacearum strain OE1–1 (Fig. S4).; Apoplast fluids are preferential for mBF formation by strain OE1–1 (Mori et al., 2016).;  This mBF formation is independent of phc QS‐dependent aggregation by OE1–1 cells (Fig. ​(Fig.4;4; Table S1).;  Taken together, these results indicate that the integrated intracellular/intercellular signalling of R. solanacearum cells via each ralfuranone and RS‐IIL, coupled with phc QS, is implicated in the regulation of mBF formation after invasion into intercellular spaces and aggregation in xylem vessels by R. solanacearum cells (Fig. S4).;  The numbers of microcolonies (Fig. S2b) of 1–5 μm in diameter, immature mBFs (Fig. S2c) of 5–10 μm in diameter and mature mBFs (Fig. S2d) of >10 μm in diameter were assessed using Nodame, and were statistically analysed using the Tukey–Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD) test (n = 15) following an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Easy R software (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan; Kanda, 2013) (Tables S1–S3).;  OE1‐1 cells produced microcolonies of 1–5 μm in diameter (b), immature mushroom‐type biofilms (mBFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter (c) and mature mBFs of >10 μm in diameter (d).;  S4 Model of the regulation of mushroom‐type biofilm (mBF) formation, the production of major exopolysaccharide EPS I and cell aggregation by Ralstonia solanacearum strain OE1‐1 through phc quorum sensing. 3‐OH MAME, methyl 3‐hydroxymyristate.; We thank Dr Takanari Tanabata for valuable suggestions on the mBF formation assay.",

pigX,100621501,17766413,2168757," Mutation of a gene (pigX) resulted in an extremely pleiotropic phenotype: prodigiosin antibiotic biosynthesis, plant virulence, and pectinase production were all elevated.;  The transcriptional start site of pigX was determined, and pigX expression occurred in parallel with Pig production.;  Partial sequence analysis suggested that the gene disrupted in these, designated pigX, might encode a GGDEF/EAL domain protein (20).;  The aim of the current study was to investigate the phenotypic consequences of the pigX mutation with respect to secondary metabolism and virulence in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.; A partial sequence of pigX was determined previously (20) and was completed as described below.;  Random-primed PCR was performed as described previously (19), using the specific primers PF111 (first-round PCR) and PF112 (second-round PCR), which generated ∼300 bp more of the pigX sequence.;  To complete the pigX sequence, a degenerate primer (PF117) was designed to the 5′ end of mreB, which was predicted based on sequence alignments to be located 3′ of pigX in Serratia strain ATCC 39006.;  The completed pigX sequence was assembled and is depicted schematically in Fig. ​Fig.1A1A.; The pigX gene encodes a GGDEF/EAL domain protein. (A) Genomic location of pigX, indicating the transcriptional start site (+1) and the insertion sites of transposons (black triangles) in strains HSPIG66 (1), ROP4S (2), and ROP4 (3). (B) Predicted GGDEF/EAL protein domain structure and inner membrane (IM) localization of PigX.; The different domains of pigX were amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pQE-80L.;  The pigX gene was amplified in two fragments.;  Primer pairs PF120 and PF129 (pTA41) or PF120 and PF136 (pTA48) were used to generate the N-terminal pigX fragments.;  Primer pairs PF121 and PF128 (pTA41) or PF121 and PF135 (pTA48) were used to generate the C-terminal pigX fragments.;  The resulting PCR fragments of the pigX mutants were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pQE-80L, previously digested with the same enzymes.;  The following specific primers were used for mapping the transcriptional start of pigX: PF94, PF93, and PF92.;  The 5′ RACE PCR products were digested with XbaI (on PF92) and SalI (on the anchor primer) and cloned into pBluescript II SK+. To determine the transcriptional start site of pigX, a number of clones were sequenced, using primer M13-20, and analyzed.; Cell-associated (intracellular) two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DiGE) proteomics comparing the pigX mutant (ROP4S) with the WT strain was performed (biological replicates and reciprocally labeled), initially as described previously but with the detergent ASB-14 instead of CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) (16) and then in a more detailed manner as described below.; Previously, the prodigiosin master regulator, PigP, was shown to negatively affect the expression of the pigX gene.;  Hyperpigmented random transposon mutant strains (ROP4 and ROP4S) and a decreased pigment production mutant strain (HSPIG66) were identified in a screen for regulators of Pig biosynthesis and were mapped either to within pigX (ROP4 and ROP4S) or 5′ of pigX (HSPIG66) (20).;  The sequence and genomic context of pigX were completed and are depicted schematically in Fig. ​Fig.1A.1A.;  Divergently transcribed from and 5′ of pigX is a 984-bp open reading frame, which is predicted to encode a homolog of YhdH from E. coli (76% similarity/69% identity), a putative quinone oxidoreductase.; Pig production by the WT, the pigX mutant (ROP4), and the intergenic pigX mutant (HSPIG66) strains was measured throughout growth in LB.;  Pig production by the pigX mutant was increased by up to approximately 350% compared with the level in the WT, whereas the intergenic mutant produced between 30 and 40% of the WT Pig levels (Fig. ​(Fig.2A).2A).;  In the intergenic mutant, the transcription of pigX is probably being driven from an internal mini-Tn5lacZ1 promoter (18), resulting in deregulated levels of the PigX repressor, causing decreased Pig production.;  In the pigX mutants, the pigment was confirmed as prodigiosin by liquid chromatography-MS analysis and the production of another antibiotic, carbapenem, was shown to be unaffected (data not shown).;  The expression of a chromosomal pigA::lacZ fusion was increased by more than 150% in the pigX mutant strain compared with its expression in the WT background (Fig. ​(Fig.2B).2B).;  This result was confirmed by primer extension analysis of the pigA-pigO transcript, which demonstrated increased pigA-pigO mRNA levels in the pigX mutant (Fig. ​(Fig.2C).2C).;  Finally, the introduction of a plasmid containing the entire pigX gene (pTA40) complemented Pig production in a pigX mutant strain to the levels observed in a WT strain carrying the vector control (see Fig. ​Fig.5).5).; PigX represses Pig production by controlling transcription of the Pig biosynthetic operon, pigA-pigO. (A) Pig levels in WT, HSPIG66 (pigXpro), and ROP4 (pigX) strains throughout growth in LB.

(D) yhdH-pigX intergenic region showing the transcription start site of pigX (+1) and the predicted −10 and −35 elements. (E) β-Galactosidase activity was measured from chromosomal pigX::lacZ and pigXpro::lacZ fusion strains throughout growth in LB.;  PL, periplasmic loop. (B) Pig assays of WT and pigX mutant (ROP4) strains in the presence of the PigX plasmids and YahA plasmid shown in panel A.; The transcriptional start of pigX was determined, with only one transcriptional start (+1) predicted to be located 98 bp 5′ of the predicted translational start (ATG).;  To examine the transcriptional profile of pigX, β-galactosidase activities from both the chromosomal pigX::lacZ fusion and the fusion 5′ of the pigX ATG were measured throughout growth in LB (Fig. ​(Fig.2E).2E).;  The expression of pigX increased in parallel with growth and continued to increase in stationary phase (Fig. ​(Fig.2E).2E).;  Interestingly, β-galactosidase activity from the intergenic fusion was approximately fourfold higher than that from the fusion in pigX.;  Therefore, the transcription of pigX increases throughout growth under the culture conditions used in the current study and mirrors the expression of the target pigA-pigO operon and Pig production (Fig. 2A and B).;  To define cellular PigX targets, global proteomic analysis was used to determine the proteins that were altered in abundance in the pigX mutant in comparison to their abundance in the WT strain.;  In an initial 2D-DiGE proteomic analysis (“difference in gel analysis”), we detected that the PigA and OpgG (an osmoregulated periplasmic glucan [OPG] biosynthesis protein) proteins, among others, were altered between the pigX mutant (ROP4S) and the WT (data not shown).;  Total cell-associated proteins were prepared from the pigX mutant (ROP4S) and the WT strains and compared using 2D-DiGE.;  Thirty-three protein spots were identified as being significantly altered (26 were increased and 7 were decreased) in the pigX mutant compared with their abundance in the WT.; The 2D-DiGE intracellular protein profile in the pigX mutant strain is altered in comparison to that in WT Serratia strain ATCC 39006.; Intracellular proteins significantly altered in abundance in the pigX mutant compared with their levels in Serratia strain ATCC 39006; Examination of the intracellular proteome of the pigX mutant strain indicated elevated levels of a protein from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 with similarity to OpgG from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Table ​(Table3).3).;  We predicted that the upregulated levels of OpgG in the pigX mutant might result in an increase in exoenzyme production and a hypervirulent phenotype.;  Pel activity was increased in the pigX mutant compared with its level in the WT strain (Fig. ​(Fig.4A),4A), whereas Cel production was not detectably altered (Fig. ​(Fig.4B).4B).;  Interestingly, overexpression of PigX in trans in the pigX mutant repressed the production of Pel (Fig. ​(Fig.4C)4C) but had no detectable effect on Cel (data not shown).;  Finally, the pigX mutant displayed a statistically significant increase in virulence in planta based on potato tuber-rotting assays (Fig. ​(Fig.4D).4D).;  A pigX opgG double mutant displayed Pel and Cel production phenotypes slightly lower than those of the opgG single mutant (Fig. 4A and B).;  The pigX opgG double mutant strain had reduced virulence compared to that of the WT strain in potato tuber-rotting assays but was more virulent than the opgG single mutant strain (Fig. ​(Fig.4D).4D).; PigX represses Pel activity and virulence in a potato tuber-rotting virulence assay.

(D) Results of potato tuber-rotting assays comparing the amount of rot caused by the WT with the amount caused by the pigX mutant (ROP4S), the opgG mutant (NW34), and the pigX opgG double mutant (4SOPG) strain, using 103 CFU as inocula.;  The difference between the WT and each mutant was statistically significant using a two-tailed paired t test with a P value of either <0.05 (*) or <0.001 (**), and the data shown are the means ± standard errors of the means of the results of at least seven independent experiments. (E) Swimming motility of the WT (LacA), a pigX mutant (ROP4S), an opgG mutant (NW34), and a pigX opgG double mutant (4SOPG) strain.; Cultures of the WT, the pigX mutant (ROP4), and the pigXpro mutant (HSPIG66) strains were grown in the presence of 32Pi, and nucleotides were extracted and analyzed by 2D thin-layer chromatography to examine total intracellular c-di-GMP levels as previously described (5, 26, 52).;  A plasmid with an E424A (ELI→ALI) substitution mutation could partially repress Pig production in a pigX mutant strain, demonstrating that the function of PigX was impaired (Fig. 5A and B).;  An E424A L425A I426A (ELI→AAA) triple amino acid substitution mutant plasmid could not complement the pigX mutant for the biosynthesis of Pig (Fig. 5A and B).;  Strikingly, the EAL domain alone fully complemented Pig production in the pigX mutant strain back to WT levels (Fig. 5A and B).;  Furthermore, plasmids expressing the GGDEF domain alone or in combination with the potential membrane-spanning region had no significant effect on Pig production in the pigX mutant.;  In addition, the expression of a construct possessing both GGDEF and EAL domains, but not the membrane spanning regions, failed to complement the pigX mutant.; To test if the PDE activity of a biochemically characterized EAL protein could function analogously to PigX, the pigX mutant strain was transformed with a plasmid expressing the EAL domain of YahA from E. coli (46) and examined for Pig production.;  The EAL domain of YahA complemented Pig production in the pigX mutant to WT levels (Fig. 5A and B).; The master secondary metabolite regulator, PigP, was shown to repress the expression of pigX (20), the predicted product of which contained GGDEF and EAL domains (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1).;  Furthermore, levels of the PigA and PigF pigment biosynthetic proteins were elevated in the pigX mutant strain in a proteomic analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.33 and Table ​Table3).3).;  Furthermore, proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and uptake were altered in the pigX mutant strain.;  Increased levels of SerC, involved in serine biosynthesis; PutA, a proline utilization membrane protein; and LivK, a periplasmic component of an ABC-type branched-chain amino acid transporter, were detected in the pigX mutant.;  In addition, the pigX mutant displayed decreased levels of AspA, an enzyme required for l-aspartate metabolism (l-aspartate is linked to serine and glycine biosynthesis) (37).;  It is possible that the elevated level of SerC, which catalyzes the second step of serine biosynthesis (37), provides increased serine for the overproduction of pigment in the pigX background.;  Therefore, the increased levels of PutA in the pigX mutant strain might suggest a drop in intracellular proline.;  Finally, PepN, an intracellular aminopeptidase, was increased in the pigX mutant background.;  Therefore, although we have speculated about links between specific altered proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and enhanced Pig production in the pigX mutant, it is possible that PigX plays a more general role in the regulation of amino acid metabolism.;  The decreased GldA and increased GlpK levels in the pigX mutant suggest that the level of glycerol-3-phosphate, which may be funneled into either glycolysis or phospholipid biosynthesis, will be elevated.; The abundance of FabI, an enoyl-ACP reductase involved in the elongation cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis, was increased in the pigX background, and FabB (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I protein) was present in an elevated mixed hit in the pigX mutant strain.;  However, mutation of pigX had no effect on N-AHL production or SmaI expression throughout the time of growth (data not shown).;  It is clear that proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism are altered in the pigX mutant, and it is possible that these pathways might be linked to the biosurfactant production observed in the pigX mutant (Williamson et al., submitted).; Vitamin B6 and vitamin B9 metabolism may also be increased in the pigX strain due to elevated levels of the SerC and GTP cyclohydrolase I enzymes, respectively (37).;  Furthermore, a predicted periplasmic lipoprotein involved in iron transport was also increased in the pigX mutant.; Finally, increased levels of OpgG were detected in the pigX mutant.;  Indeed, Pel production was shown to be repressed by PigX and the pigX mutant was hypervirulent in a potato tuber-rotting model (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).;  Mutation of opgG resulted in reduced exoenzyme production and decreased virulence in planta, even in the hyper-producing pigX mutant background (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).;  However, there is little overlap between those results and the ones reported here for the pigX mutant.;  These experiments revealed that, in addition to the alteration in the secondary metabolite production phenotype of a pigX mutant strain, proteins involved in primary metabolism and virulence are also affected, indicating a far more pleiotropic role of PigX than initially thought.;  Second, the EAL domain of PigX alone could fully complement Pig production and swarming (data not shown) in the pigX mutant strain.;  Finally, it is interesting that PDE mutations (and increased c-di-GMP) commonly result in decreased virulence, whereas in this study, mutation of pigX caused an increase in virulence.;  The transcriptional start site of pigX was determined, and its expression followed a pattern similar to that of Pig production, increasing throughout the time of growth in LB, with maximal levels present in stationary phase (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2).;  The pleiotropic master regulator PigP was shown to strongly repress the transcription of pigX (20).",

rep,1263216,15746369,1065173,"Here we describe the rep gene, isolated from an environmental DNA library, which when transformed into Streptomyces species resulted in increased production of secondary metabolites and accelerated sporulation.;  We show that Streptomyces lividans strains bearing rep are particularly useful as expression hosts for heterologous antibiotic production.;  These include polyketides, produced by microbes such as Streptomyces, Saccharopolyspora, and Aspergillus species.; Because of their ease of use and ability to express polyketides, Streptomyces species are logical surrogate hosts for soil DNA libraries.;  Streptomyces lividans is usually preferred for genetic manipulation because it lacks methylation-dependent restriction, allowing efficient transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli cloning strains.;  However, S. lividans does not produce antibiotics as abundantly as does Streptomyces coelicolor, and its morphological development is delayed (6).;  We show here that the rep gene, isolated from a soil environmental DNA library, confers to S. lividans both accelerated sporulation and overproduction of endogenous and heterologous secondary metabolites.; Cosmid 2A7, previously isolated as part of a soil DNA library (2), contains approximately 40.4 kb of soil DNA cloned into the E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pOSI700.;  The 2A7 phenotypes were carbon source dependent; they were not observed when glucose was omitted or replaced by mannitol or glycerol (0.2 and 0.5%, respectively).;  To test whether 2A7 could increase heterologous antibiotic production, pSGran, an integrative bacterial artificial chromosome containing the granaticin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces violeacoruber Tu22 (8), and the corresponding empty BAC vector were conjugated into S. lividans Δact Δred containing cosmid 2A7.;  As before, increased sporulation and secondary metabolite production were glucose dependent (not observed when glucose was replaced by glycerol or mannitol) and occurred even in the presence of a high copper concentration (R5 with 2 μM CuCl2), which has been shown to accelerate spore production in S. lividans (4).;  Thus, 2A7 appears to bypass glucose repression of sporulation and antibiotic biosynthesis in S. lividans (6).; Extracts of S. lividans Δact Δred/2A7 with and without pSGran were prepared and tested for antibacterial activity.;  We transformed each into S. lividans TK24 act+red+ and found that disruption of a single ORF, rep, resulted in complete loss of glucose-dependent early sporulation, indicating that rep is necessary for this phenotype (data not shown).;  To test whether rep was sufficient to confer the 2A7 phenotypes, a 1.5-kb fragment of cosmid 2A7 containing the rep ORF and 290 bp of upstream sequence was PCR amplified, using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and primers 2A7.repS.5′ (GCAAGCTTGGTGCGTCGCCGGCACGTCGAGCTCGTGCA) and 2A7.rep.3′ (GCAAGCTTGTAGACGCCGCAGTCCACGATGACACGG) as recommended by the manufacturer in the presence of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, with the following conditions: 98°C for 10 min; 30 cycles of 98°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min; and 72°C for 10 min.;  The PCR product was cloned into pBlunt-TOPO (Invitrogen), yielding pTOPO.rep, and then rep was reisolated by HindIII digestion and cloned into the HindIII site of pOSI700, yielding pOSI.rep.;  The phenotype of S. lividans TK24 bearing pOSI.rep and grown on glucose-containing medium (Fig. ​(Fig.4A)4A) showed that the rep gene was sufficient to confer early sporulation and increased antibiotic production. rep was also tested in S. coelicolor to assess its effect in other Streptomyces species.;  BstXI/EcoRI adapters (Invitrogen) were first ligated to the rep PCR product, using a standard blunt-end ligation procedure.;  The resulting rep fragment was gel purified and ligated to 20 ng of BstXI-cut pMBD13 vector (10:1, vector to insert molar ratio) at 16°C for 6 h.;  The resulting plasmid, pMBD.rep, was transformed into E. coli ET12567/pUB307 and conjugated into S. coelicolor M145 by standard procedures (5).;  S. coelicolor M145 transformants containing pMBD.rep overproduced antibiotics in glucose-containing medium compared to control S. coelicolor strains transformed with the empty vector (Fig. ​(Fig.4B).4B).;  Therefore, rep can increase antibiotic production in at least one additional Streptomyces species and thus may be of value for other Streptomyces strains of commercial interest.; (A) rep is sufficient to confer the 2A7 phenotype.;  S. lividans TK24 transformed with pOSI700 (top) or pOSI.rep (bottom) was inoculated onto R5 or SMM glucose (Glu) agar and grown at 30°C for 6 or 3 days, respectively. (B) rep increases antibiotic production in S. coelicolor M145.;  S. coelicolor M145 containing the control vector pMBD14 (top) or pMBD.rep (bottom) was inoculated onto R5 or SMM glucose agar and grown for 4 or 5 days, respectively.; Sequence analyses indicated that rep encodes a putative 389-amino-acid transcriptional repressor of the ROK family (for repressor, ORF, kinase; Pfam motif PF00480 [12]).;  The transcriptional repressors of this family, such as B. subtilis xylR and E. coli nagC, encompass a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif at the N terminus followed by a ROK sugar-binding domain.;  In the absence of the appropriate inducing sugar, these repressors bind to their operator sequences and regulate gene expression.;  Binding of the inducing sugars to the ROK domain results in dissociation of the repressor-operator complex (9).;  Among the members of the ROK family, Rep is most similar (48% identity, 68% similarity) to NP630122, a putative transcriptional repressor of unknown function from S. coelicolor A3 (2); NP823424, also a putative repressor from Streptomyces avermitilis; and NagR, the putative repressor of an ABC transporter system that mediates uptake of N-acetylglucosamine in Streptomyces olivaceoviridis (13).; The rep gene, derived from an environmental library, was shown both to accelerate sporulation and to enhance production levels of secondary metabolites, specifically endogenous and heterologous antibiotics.;  Streptomyces strains bearing this sequence can thus be used not only as improved production hosts for endogenous secondary metabolites but also for screening libraries of soil DNA samples for heterologous secondary metabolites, thereby enhancing our ability to detect novel compounds produced in environmental libraries.; The sequence of the rep gene has been deposited in GenBank (accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AY684299"",""term_id"":""51895361""}}AY684299).",
sare0718,5704523,22655051,3360062,"In order to investigate cryptic NRP-related metabolites in S. arenicola CNS-205, we cloned and identified the putative gene sare0718 annotated “amino acid adenylation domain”. Firstly, the general features and possible functions of sare0718 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, which suggested that Sare0718 is a soluble protein with an AMP-binding domain contained in the sequence and its cognate substrate is L-Val.; By revealing the biochemical role of sare0718 gene, we identified an alanine-activating adenylation domain in marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola CNS-205, which would provide useful information for next isolation and function elucidation of the whole cryptic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-related gene cluster covering Sare0718.;  Interestingly, except for sare0718, each of the 15 other “amino acid adenylation domain” loci has a corresponding NRPS gene cluster (as shown in Table 1) and all of them belong to the 10 NRPS-related biosynthetic gene clusters predicted by Penn K etc. in 2009 using bioinformatics [21], [22]. In contrast, the definite function of sare0718 or its NRPS-related gene cluster remains poorly understood.;  Consequently, we expressed sare0718 gene and identified its biochemical roles as an alanine-activating adenylation domain.;  Our work would facilitate next isolation and functional elucidation of the whole cryptic NRPS-related gene cluster containing sare0718.; Before performing the experiment, bioinformatics analysis of sare0718 was carried out to better understand the general features and possible functions of the gene.; The gene sare0718 was amplified by PCR from S. arenicola CNS-205 genomic DNA.;  Analysis of 1% agrose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1A) showed that the size of sare0718 gene is about 1700 bp, similar to the reported length (1671 bp).;  To construct a prokaryotic expression plasmid, PCR product of sare0718 was cloned into pGEX-2T vector.;  Finally, the resulting expression constructs were further verified by direct DNA sequencing, and designated pGEX-2T-sare0718.; (A) Amplification of sare0718 gene by PCR.;  M: DL2000 DNA marker; 1: PCR product of sare0718.

E.Coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells were then transformed with recombinant plasmid pGEX-2T-sare0718, and induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at 16°C for 24 h to express target protein.; In this paper, sare0718, the gene of a putative amino acid adenylation domain, was cloned and identified as an alanine-activating adenylation domain for further investigation into cryptic NRPS-related gene clusters in S. arenicola CNS-205.;  First of all, the general features and possible functions of sare0718 gene were predicted by bioinformatics analysis before our experiments.;  Based on these bioinformatics data, experiments were performed to study the concrete function of sare0718 gene.;  As for S. arenicola CNS-205, 10 NRPS-related gene clusters were revealed in its 5 786 361 bp circular chromosome by completed genome sequencing analysis [23]. However, according to our analysis in Table 1, gene sare0718 belongs to none of them.;  Besides, we found that the nearest genes adjacent to sare0718 are sare0716 (Enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase), sare0717 (a hypothetical protein), and sare0719 (4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase).;  Our investigation into the substrate specificity of Sare0718 as described in this paper is useful information in identifying the cryptic NRPS-related gene cluster containing sare0718.; In order to aid in understanding of the sare0718 gene, certain computational methods were utilized.; The gene sare0718 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from the producer organism S. arenicola CNS-205 (GenBank accession no.;  The forward primer (5′- CCGGGATCCCAGCGCACCTCGACCACCACGACGGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCCGAATTCTCGCGTCGCCCCCTGCTCCTGGCTG-3′) used for amplification of the sare0718 gene introduced BamH I and EcoR I restriction sites (underlined), respectively.;  The PCR product of sare0718 was cloned into the digested pGEX-2T vector using the corresponding BamH I/EcoR I restriction sites.;  The recombinant plasmid bearing DNA encoding Sare0718 protein was verified by sequencing and designated pGEX-2T-sare0718.; For recombinant protein expression and purification, E.coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells were transformed with purified pGEX-2T-sare0718 plasmids.",
scbA,1101707,21342469,3818864," Here we show the results of a genome‐wide transcriptome analysis of a scbA deletion mutant prior to and during the transition to antibiotic production.;  Also, ScbR binds the promoter of scbA (site A); however, with an opposite effect: its presence is necessary for scbA induction (Takano et al., 2001). scbA is divergent from scbR, and its deletion impairs production of SCBs, and causes an earlier and enhanced Red and Act production (Takano et al., 2001). scbA and scbR expression is absent in the S. coelicolor scbA deletion mutant M751; addition of SCB1 restores scbR transcription, but not that of scbA.;  To analyse the role of ScbA and the butanolide system more extensively, gene expression in a scbA deletion mutant (M751), just before and during the onset of antibiotic production, was compared with the wild‐type M145 using whole‐genome microarrays and quantitative RT‐PCR (qRT‐PCR) analyses.; Antibiotic production in the scbA deletion mutant (M751) occurs earlier and leads to a 10‐fold higher final yield of both Act and Red than that of the wild‐type (M145) strain (Takano et al., 2001).; Growth curves of the wild‐type and the ΔscbA mutant.;  Cell growth in liquid SMM medium of the wild type (dark line, diamond) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line, square) was monitored in time, measuring the absorbance of the culture at OD450.;  Undecylprodigiosin production started at the beginning of the transition phase in the wild type (red bar) and at mid‐exponential phase in the ΔscbA mutant (red bar).; Identification of perturbed genes in the ΔscbA mutant using principal component analysis (PCA).A.;  Microarray analysis of global transcription profile of the wild type (left panel) and the ΔscbA mutant (right panel), sorted by hierarchical clustering.;  The gene expression values in wild type (green line) and the ΔscbA mutant (red line) were analysed by PCA, and the values of principal component 1 are plotted versus principal component 2.;  The two main patterns of the difference expression profile between the wild type and the ΔscbA mutant are shown, based on the loadings of PC‐1 (dark line) and PC‐2 (light line) in PCA of the expression difference profiles.;  In addition to undecylprodigiosin, scbA mutant M751 overproduced the blue‐pigmented actinorhodin, also consistent with an earlier report (Takano et al., 2001).; Expression profiles of secondary metabolism genes in the wild type and the ΔscbA mutant.;  The average expression profiles of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters red (SCO5877–5898), act (SCO5071–5091), cpk (SCO6268–6288) and des (SCO2782–2785) during the time‐course are plotted for the wild type (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  Expression profiles of genes of the red cluster [redD (SCO5877) and redQ (SCO5887)] (A), the act cluster [actII‐orf4 (SCO5085) and actIII (SCO5086)] (B), the cpk cluster [cpkE (SCO6277), cpkO (SCO6280) and scbR2 (SCO6286)] (C) are plotted for the wild type (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).; Most dramatically, the cpk cluster (SCO6268–6288) was silenced in M751 throughout the entire growth curve (Fig. 3), while in the wild type it showed a sharp overexpression from TP4 onwards, coinciding with the expression peak of scbA and scbR (Fig. S1).; Expression profiles of primary metabolism genes in M145 and the ΔscbA mutant.;  The average of genes involved in conversion of pyruvate to acetyl‐CoA (ace) and from acetyl‐CoA to malonyl‐CoA (ACCase complex) and the average expression profiles of the primary metabolism genes for the PPP and glycolysis pathways during the time‐course are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The average expression profiles of a set of morphological differentiation genes and the conservon 9 [cvn9 (rar)] are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The fold change between the ΔscbA mutant and M145 of expression profiles of 11 genes (indicated at the side) overlapping putative ncRNAs are plotted.;  These data agree with the reported abolished expression of cpkO, the pathway‐specific activator of the cpk cluster in the scbA mutant (Takano et al., 2005).; Another secondary metabolite cluster drastically affected by deleting scbA was the siderophore desferrioxamine E biosynthesis.;  These findings agree with the earlier production of antibiotics, suggesting that the deletion of scbA causes a shift of the primary metabolism pathways, which is required for Act and Red production.;  Earlier production of aerial hyphae or spores have not been reported in the scbA mutant (Takano et al., 2001), and we also did not observe any difference in development on solid media between the wild type and the mutant.;  Strengthening this hypothesis, the differential expression profile, between the wild type and the scbA mutant, of SCO4189 and devA is anticorrelated (data not shown).;  Expression profiles of scbA (SCO6266) (values from qRT‐PCR analysis), scbR (SCO6265) (values from qRT‐PCR analysis) and scbC (SCO6267) (values from microarray analysis) are plotted for M145 (dark line) and the ΔscbA mutant (light line).;  The expression fold change for scbA and scbR is compared with the value in M145 at TP1, which is set as 1.;  Standard deviation for scbA and scbR qRT‐PCR analysis at each time point is denoted in a thin light line.",

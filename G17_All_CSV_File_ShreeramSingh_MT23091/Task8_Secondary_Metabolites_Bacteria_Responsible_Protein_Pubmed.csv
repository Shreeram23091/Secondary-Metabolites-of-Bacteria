NRPS,NRPS enzyme complex,"This study focuses on the distribution of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMBGCs) within the Hahella genus, particularly H. chejuensis and H. ganghwensis. Using anti-SMASH analysis, 70 SMBGCs were identified across five genomes, with an average of 12 clusters per strain. The majority of these clusters (45.7%) belong to the NRPS and NRPS/PKS families, suggesting significant potential for discovering bioactive compounds. One strain, NBU794, isolated from mangrove soil in China, exhibited 17 SMBGCs and produced chejuenolide A-C and nine prodiginines derivatives, including prodigiosin. Prodigiosin and 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. Additionally, the yield of prodigiosin from H. chejuensis NBU794 reached 1.40 g/L under non-optimized conditions and increased to 5.83 g/L with modified medium, highlighting the strain's promise as a prodigiosin source. Overall, this study underscores the potential of Hahella species, particularly NBU794, for synthesizing novel bioactive compounds, with prodigiosin showing significant antimicrobial properties.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35447942/,10.3390/md20040269
PKS,PKS enzyme complex,"Type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) are complex multienzymes responsible for synthesizing fatty acids from acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. Two distinct architectures have evolved: yeast-type FAS (yFAS) and metazoan FAS (mFAS). yFAS is a barrel-shaped structure specialized for saturated fatty acid production, while mFAS is an X-shaped dimer with modular assembly lines resembling polyketide synthases (PKSs). PKSs generate diverse secondary metabolites either iteratively (iPKS) or through modular assembly (modPKSs). Recent studies have provided insights into yFAS re-engineering and revealed the organization and dynamics of iPKSs, including a mycocerosic acid synthase-like Pks5 model. Functional studies of specialized domains like the product template (PT) and starter-unit acyltransferase (SAT) have elucidated non-reducing iterative PKS (NR-PKSs) principles. High-resolution visualization of a six-domain loading region and cryo-EM studies of a loading intermediate shed light on NR-PKS action. These findings unveil the diverse architectures and dynamics of mFAS, iPKS, and modPKSs, crucial for understanding PKS functionality and evolution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137093/,10.1039/c8np00039e
Hybrid NRPS-PKS,Hybrid NRPS-PKS enzyme complex,"Serratia plymuthica strain RVH1, isolated from an industrial food processing environment, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacterial pathogens. Structure determination revealed two polyamino antibiotics, zeamine and zeamine II, along with a closely related analogue, zeamine I. The gene cluster responsible for zeamine biosynthesis was sequenced, encoding FAS, PKS, NRPS, and putative tailoring/export enzymes. Interestingly, some genes share homology with those involved in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in marine bacteria. This suggests a unique interplay between secondary lipid and metabolite biosynthesis. The zeamine antibiotics are hypothesized to be produced as prodrugs, undergoing activation through cleavage of a nonribosomal peptide sequence. This intricate mechanism highlights the complexity of microbial secondary metabolite production and potential for novel antibiotic discovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23349809/,10.1371/journal.pone.0054143
DMATS ,DMATS enzyme,"Ergot alkaloids, both toxins and pharmaceuticals, are industrially produced through biotechnology. Dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS; EC 2.5.1.34) catalyzes the first committed step in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis. DMATS orthologs are widespread in fungal genomes. The x-ray structure of DMATS from Aspergillus fumigatus, determined at 1.76 A resolution, reveals its interaction with its substrates L-tryptophan and dimethylallyl diphosphate. This elucidates the enzyme's regiospecific Friedel-Crafts reaction at position 4 of the indole nucleus of tryptophan, independently of Mg(2+) ions. DMATS possesses a unique beta/alpha barrel fold known as the prenyltransferase barrel, previously identified in bacterial enzymes unrelated to DMATS. These bacterial enzymes catalyze aromatic substrate prenylation, akin to DMATS, shedding light on the structural basis of this reaction and its significance in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19706516/,10.1073/pnas.0904897106
TP53,Tumor Protein 53,"The study evaluated the toxicity of Lactobacillus plantarum secondary metabolites on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and Drosophila melanogaster, analyzing gene expression levels and molecular binding poses. Drosophila melanogaster served as a model with preserved human gene homologs, showing IC50 values of 0.0011 mg/ml for MCF-7 cells and LC50/LC99 values of 0.24 mg/ml and 0.54 mg/ml for fruit fly adults. Decreased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL-2 and BUFFY) and increased apoptotic gene expression (DECAY, FADD, RAS64B) were noted in D. melanogaster. The secondary metabolite L13 demonstrated high binding affinity with the studied genes, suggesting potential therapeutic applications against breast cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31673827/,10.1007/s00280-019-03978-0
